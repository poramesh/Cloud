S3 Event Notifications:

Event Notifications in S3 allow for the automatic sending of information about events (e.g., object creation, deletion) to
other AWS services like SNS, SQS, or Lambda.
Use Case: You can send notifications when an object is uploaded (PUT, POST events) to trigger further actions in other services like processing or sending alerts.

Setting Up S3 Event Notifications:

Create S3 Bucket:
Create a new S3 bucket (e.g., events-notifications-lab).

Create SNS Topic:
In SNS, create a new standard topic (e.g., my-email) to handle notifications.
Set up an email subscription to the topic to receive notifications via email.
Confirm the subscription via email.

Configure Event Notifications in S3:
Navigate to the Properties tab of the S3 bucket.
Under Event Notifications, create a new notification:
Set a name (e.g., upload-event).
Prefix and Suffix: Optionally set conditions for objects (e.g., only for objects with .jpeg).
Set to trigger on object creation events (PUT, POST, etc.).

Choose Destination:
Select SNS as the destination service.
Choose the SNS topic created earlier.

Error Handling (Permission Issue):
If you receive an error like "unable to validate destination configurations," it means permissions need to be set.
Add a resource-based policy to the SNS topic to allow S3 to send messages.

Example policy: Grants sns:Publish permission from S3 to the SNS topic.
Get the ARNs for the SNS topic and S3 bucket and the account ID for the owner.
Update the SNS Access Policy with the new permissions.
Save changes.

    }
  ]
}



Test Event Notification:
Upload an object to the S3 bucket (e.g., a .yaml file).
An object creation event triggers the notification.

Email Notification:
After uploading the object, check the email for a notification.
The email contains metadata about the object creation event, including:
Event source (S3), region, timestamp, object key, etc.
Information about the API action used (PUT).
Principal, source IP, and other metadata.

Use Case for Lambda:
If the notification is sent to Lambda, Lambda could process the metadata (e.g., object key, bucket name) and perform actions on the uploaded object, 
such as:
Image processing
File validation
Data extraction

Summary:
S3 event notifications allow the automation of processes based on events in the S3 bucket.
SNS is used to notify users or trigger further processing (e.g., Lambda) via email or other services.
Permissions: Ensure that the correct permissions are set for the SNS topic to allow S3 to publish notifications.
