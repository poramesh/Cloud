Exam Cram Notes for Amazon S3

General Information

File Storage: S3 supports any file type, from 0 bytes to 5 TB.
Storage Capacity: Unlimited storage available.
Global Namespace: Bucket names must be globally unique.
Region-Specific: Buckets are created in specific regions to reduce latency.
Flat Storage: Buckets are flat containers; no hierarchy, but object keys or prefixes can mimic folders.
Consistency: S3 offers strong read-after-write consistency.
%%%
Strong read-after-write consistency in Amazon S3 means that after you successfully write (or update) an object to S3, you can immediately 
retrieve that object with a read request, and it will reflect the most recent write or update.
You upload an object (e.g., file.txt) to S3 at 12:00 PM.
At 12:01 PM, you or another user reads file.txt. S3 will return the object with the exact contents you uploaded.

Buckets

Limit: 100 buckets per account by default (limit can be increased).
Replication: Objects remain in the same region unless replication is enabled.
Permissions: Can be defined at any time.
Nested Buckets: Not supported.



Objects

Storage Classes:
Standard, Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-IA, One Zone-IA, Glacier Instant Retrieval, Glacier Flexible Retrieval, Glacier Deep Archive, etc.
Understand features and use cases for each.

Unique Keys: Objects are stored and retrieved by unique keys.

Versioning:
Enables multiple versions of an object in the same bucket.
Helps recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.



Policies and Permissions

IAM Policies:
Identity-based, no principal defined.
Best for managing numerous buckets or cross-service access.

Bucket Policies:
Resource-based, specific to S3 buckets.
Best for cross-account access or when IAM size limits are reached.

Access Control Lists (ACLs):
Legacy mechanism, limited options for grantees and permissions.
Prefer IAM policies or bucket policies.



Lifecycle Management

Actions:
Transition Actions: Move objects between storage classes.
Expiration Actions: Permanently delete objects after a set time.

Unsupported Transitions:
No transitions to Reduced Redundancy.
Certain transitions between Intelligent-Tiering, Standard-IA, and One Zone-IA are unsupported.



Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA Delete:
Requires versioning to be enabled.
Only bucket owners can enable MFA Delete.

Protected API Access:
Enforces MFA for accessing resources.
Uses AWS MultiFactorAuthAge in bucket policies.




Encryption

Server-Side Encryption:
SSE-S3: Uses S3-managed keys.
SSE-C: You provide your own keys.
SSE-KMS: Uses AWS Key Management Service.

Client-Side Encryption:
You manage encryption before uploading objects.

Default Encryption:
Automatically encrypts new objects in a bucket.




Event Notifications

Triggered on events like object creation, deletion, etc.
Destinations: SNS, SQS, Lambda.



Multipart Upload

Used for large files (>5 GB, recommended for files >100 MB).
Uploads files in parts, allowing parallel uploads.


Transfer Acceleration
Speeds up file transfers by leveraging CloudFront edge locations.
Reduces latency for long-distance uploads/downloads.
Can only be suspended, not disabled.



Copy API

Copy objects up to 5 GB.
Use cases: Generate copies, rename, change storage class, move between regions, modify metadata.



Logging

Server Access Logging:
Logs request details (e.g., requester, bucket, request time).
Requires a separate bucket for log storage.
Disabled by default.

CORS: Configured using JSON rules.




Cross-Account Access

Programmatic Access: Use resource-based policies or IAM policies.
Programmatic & Console Access: Use cross-account IAM roles.



Performance Optimization

Limits:
3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE or 5,500 GET/HEAD requests per second per prefix.

Strategies:
Parallelize reads/writes.
Use Byte-Range Fetches.
Retry requests for latency-sensitive applications.
Use EC2 in the same region.
Leverage S3 Transfer Acceleration.
