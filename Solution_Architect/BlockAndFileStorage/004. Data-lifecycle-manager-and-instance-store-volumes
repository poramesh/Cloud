 Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)


Overview

Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) is an AWS tool designed to automate the backup and lifecycle management of Amazon EBS snapshots
and EBS-backed AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).

Snapshot Basics
Snapshots are point-in-time backups of EBS volumes.
Snapshots are stored on Amazon S3 and support incremental backups:
Initial snapshot: Backs up the entire volume.
Subsequent snapshots: Only back up changes since the previous snapshot.

Snapshots can be used to:
Create volumes in another availability zone (AZ) and attach them to EC2 instances.
Create AMIs (Amazon Machine Images) for launching EC2 instances.



Features of DLM
DLM automates several key tasks related to EBS backups:

Backup Automation:
Automatically creates snapshots and AMIs on a defined schedule.

Retention Management:
Automates retention by defining how long backups are kept.
Ensures outdated backups are deleted to save storage costs.

Disaster Recovery:
Supports creating backup policies to replicate data to another AWS account.

Standardization:
Enables the creation of standardized AMIs and keeps them updated automatically.

Compliance and Auditing:
Retains backups as required for compliance or auditing purposes.

Cost Optimization:
Reduces storage costs by removing unnecessary or outdated backups.



Benefits of DLM

Protects Data:
Enforces a regular and reliable backup schedule.

Streamlines Operations:
Eliminates the need for manual backup processes.

Supports Disaster Recovery:
Simplifies cross-account backup policies for redundancy.

Enhances Compliance:
Ensures data is retained for the required time for audits and regulations.

Cost Efficiency:
Automatically deletes older backups, minimizing storage expenses.


DLM in Practice

Configuration:
You define lifecycle policies to manage snapshots and AMIs.
Policies include rules for:
Backup frequency.
Retention duration.
Deletion after a specified period.

Use Cases:
Automating regular backups of critical EC2 instances.
Maintaining up-to-date AMIs for a standard environment.
Meeting compliance and disaster recovery requirements.

Key Takeaways
DLM is a practical tool for simplifying and automating backup management.
It ensures regular backups, cost optimization, and compliance with minimal manual intervention.
Hands-on practice is essential to understand the process and configurations in real-world scenarios.






EBS Volumes vs. Instance Store Volumes

Overview

Amazon EC2 instances can use two types of volumes:
Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volumes: Persistent, network-attached storage.
Instance Store Volumes: High-performance, ephemeral storage physically attached to the host server.


1. Elastic Block Store (EBS) Volumes

EBS volumes are network-attached block storage that provides persistent data storage for EC2 instances.
The data on EBS persists even after the instance is stopped or terminated.

Key Features:

Persistent Storage:
Data remains available after instance shutdown or termination.
Can be reattached to other EC2 instances.

Network-Attached:
EBS volumes connect to the instance over a network.

Versatility:
Used for various use cases such as databases, file systems, or application data storage.

Backups:
Snapshots of EBS volumes can be stored in S3 for backup, replication, or migration.

Detachable:
EBS volumes can be detached from one instance and reattached to another.


2. Instance Store Volumes

Instance store volumes are physically attached disks directly connected to the host server where the EC2 instance runs.
Designed for temporary high-performance storage.

Key Features:

Ephemeral (Non-Persistent) Storage:
Data is lost when the instance is stopped or the host server fails.
Instance stores cannot survive instance termination.

High Performance:
Offers extremely high read/write performance due to physical proximity to the host server.
Suitable for temporary storage and high-speed processing.

Use Cases:
Temporary data like caches, buffers, or scratch space.
Applications that replicate data across instances and do not rely on a single persistent source.

Limitations:
Cannot be detached or reattached to the same or another EC2 instance.
Root volumes on instance stores prevent an instance from being stopped; only restarts are allowed.

Key Differences: EBS vs. Instance Store

Feature                 	EBS Volume	                             Instance Store Volume
Storage Type	            Network-attached	                       Physically attached to the host server
Persistence	              Persistent	                             Ephemeral (non-persistent)
Performance	              High but depends on ntwk latency	       Extremely high (local storage)
Data Retention	          Survives instance stop/termination       Data is lost when the instance stops
Attach/Detach	            Can be detached and reattached	         Cannot be detached or reattached
Use Cases	                Databases, application data, backups	   Caches, buffers, temporary data, scratch disks
Backup Options	          Supports snapshots (backed by Amazon S3)	No built-in backup support
Cost                     	Generally more expensive	                Cost-effective for temporary storage
Root Device Behavior	    Can be stopped, restarted,or terminated	  Can only be restarted (not stopped)



Use Cases for Instance Store Volumes

Caches and Buffers:
Temporary storage for frequently changing data that doesn't need to persist.

Scratch Data:
Short-lived data for computations or temporary files during processing.

High-Performance Applications:
Applications that need ultra-low latency and high throughput.

Distributed Applications:
Systems where data is replicated across multiple EC2 instances for redundancy.


How Instance Store Volumes Are Created
Root devices for instance store volumes are created from Amazon Machine Image (AMI) templates stored in Amazon S3.
These AMIs are loaded directly onto the instance store volume at instance launch.


Summary
EBS is ideal for persistent, versatile, and network-attached storage needs.
Instance Store is best for temporary, high-performance storage with no persistence requirements.
The choice depends on the applicationâ€™s needs for data durability, performance, and cost.






Data persistence is crucial in scenarios where data must be retained and remain accessible even after system reboots, crashes, or shutdowns. 
Below are some examples where data persistence is necessary:

1. Database Systems
Example: Online transaction processing systems like banking, e-commerce platforms, or inventory management.
Why Needed: Customer records, order history, and financial transactions must be preserved to ensure data integrity and compliance with regulations.
Solution: Persistent storage like EBS volumes or managed database services such as Amazon RDS or DynamoDB.


2. Content Management Systems
Example: Websites like WordPress blogs or news platforms.
Why Needed: Articles, images, videos, and other user-uploaded content must be stored persistently so users can access them at any time.
Solution: Persistent storage solutions like Amazon S3 or EBS volumes.

3. Application Configurations
Example: Enterprise applications with critical configuration files or user settings.
Why Needed: Configuration data must persist so the application can start in a consistent state after a restart or crash.
Solution: Use persistent storage or centralized configuration management services.

4. Logging and Auditing
Example: Security logs in a financial institution or access logs for regulatory compliance.
Why Needed: Logs must be retained for extended periods for forensic analysis, audits, or troubleshooting.
Solution: Persistent storage like Amazon S3 with lifecycle policies for long-term retention.

5. Virtual Machines and Containers
Example: Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) or containerized applications with stateful components.
Why Needed: Operating systems and application states must persist across reboots or container migrations.
Solution: Persistent block storage like EBS volumes for VM root disks or Kubernetes persistent volumes.

6. File Storage for Collaboration
Example: Shared file systems like Dropbox, Google Drive, or internal file-sharing solutions.
Why Needed: Files uploaded or shared by users must persist so they can access and share them over time.
Solution: Persistent file storage solutions like Amazon EFS or object storage like S3.

7. Data Analytics and Machine Learning
Example: Storing large datasets for training ML models or conducting analysis.
Why Needed: Training data and results must persist to ensure reproducibility and to build models over time.
Solution: Persistent storage solutions like S3 or high-throughput volumes for data lakes.

8. Backup and Disaster Recovery
Example: A business maintaining backups of its critical systems.
Why Needed: Ensures data can be restored in the event of a hardware failure, accidental deletion, or disaster.
Solution: Snapshots, S3 Glacier, or other durable storage solutions.







Here are real-time examples for each use case of instance store volumes:

1. Caches and Buffers
Use Case: Temporary storage for frequently changing data that doesn't need to persist.

Example:

Content Delivery Networks (CDN):
When delivering media (e.g., video streaming) from a CDN edge server, frequently accessed data can be cached in the instance store.
This allows fast access without persisting the data permanently.

Example services: CloudFront, Akamai.


Web Server Caching:
A web application stores frequently accessed data (e.g., pre-rendered HTML or API responses) temporarily in the instance store for rapid access.


2. Scratch Data

Use Case: Short-lived data for computations or temporary files during processing.

Example:

Big Data Analytics:
While running a big data workload on Apache Hadoop or Spark, intermediate data during transformations (like shuffling and sorting) is 
stored temporarily on the instance store for faster processing.

Video Editing and Rendering:
During rendering of high-definition videos, temporary files created for encoding or intermediate effects can be stored on the instance store for high speed.

Machine Learning Training:
Temporary datasets during model training on frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch are cached locally in the instance store.


3. High-Performance Applications

Use Case: Applications that need ultra-low latency and high throughput.

Example:
Gaming Servers:
Multiplayer online gaming servers (e.g., for games like Fortnite or Call of Duty) require rapid processing of game state updates. Instance
stores offer the speed required for these high-throughput operations.

Real-Time Financial Transactions:
High-frequency trading systems (e.g., on stock exchanges) require extremely low latency to process financial transactions and maintain a competitive edge.


4. Distributed Applications

Use Case: Systems where data is replicated across multiple EC2 instances for redundancy.

Example:

Distributed Databases:
Cassandra or MongoDB clusters replicate data across multiple nodes. Temporary, high-speed storage like an instance store can hold replicated data for
quick access without relying on persistent storage.

Microservices Architecture:
Applications with multiple stateless microservices (e.g., for e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Shopify) use instance stores for temporary logs, 
session data, or shared state among replicas.

Media Transcoding Pipelines:
In a distributed pipeline, individual worker nodes transcode segments of a video file. Each node stores intermediate transcoded data in 
its instance store before forwarding it.

Key Takeaway
Instance stores are perfect for scenarios where performance is critical and data persistence is unnecessary, such as caches, temporary computations,
or distributed systems with built-in redundancy.

Microservices Architecture Overview
Stateless Microservices:

In microservices, each service is often stateless. This means they do not store any persistent state (like user data or order history) within the service itself.
Instead, stateful information is stored in a database or external storage, making services easier to scale and recover.

Use Cases of Instance Stores in Microservices

1. Temporary Logs
Scenario: A stateless microservice processes requests (e.g., adding items to a shopping cart or calculating shipping costs).
How It Works:
Temporary logs are written to the instance store to track real-time events, such as:
Request start and end times.
Debugging details.
Temporary transaction logs.
These logs can be processed and either pushed to a centralized logging service (like Amazon CloudWatch or Elasticsearch) or discarded after use.

2. Session Data
Scenario: When a user logs into an e-commerce site, their session data might be temporarily cached to ensure faster processing 
of subsequent requests (e.g., browsing categories or adding items to a cart).
How It Works:
Session data (e.g., user authentication tokens, cart details) is stored temporarily on the instance store for faster access.
Since microservices are often stateless, the session data is backed up in a shared cache (like Amazon ElastiCache with Redis) 
or a database to ensure redundancy if the instance fails.

3. Shared State Among Replicas
Scenario: A microservice might be scaled horizontally, creating multiple replicas for handling traffic (e.g., checkout service replicas for handling payment processing).
How It Works:
Temporary shared states, such as intermediary calculations, buffers, or caching frequently accessed configurations, are stored in the instance store.
Other replicas can retrieve or synchronize this data using shared in-memory systems like Memcached or directly through a replicated mechanism in the application.



Example Workflow: Adding to Cart
Microservices:

A Cart Service receives the request to add an item to a cart.
A Pricing Service calculates the total cost based on discounts or taxes.
Temporary Data in Instance Store:

Cart Service writes temporary logs about the request to its instance store (e.g., time taken, success or failure).
Pricing Service stores intermediate pricing calculations in the instance store, ensuring fast reads/writes during processing.
Outcome:

Once the request is completed, the temporary logs and calculations in the instance store are discarded.
The final cart state is saved to a persistent database (like DynamoDB or RDS).



Cassandra or MongoDB clusters replicate data across multiple nodes. Temporary, high-speed storage like an instance store can hold replicated data for
quick access without relying on persistent storage. what does this mean

The statement refers to the use of temporary, high-speed storage (like an instance store) in distributed database systems such as Cassandra or MongoDB for specific 
performance-optimized purposes. Here's a detailed explanation:

What Cassandra and MongoDB Do

Distributed Nature:
Both Cassandra and MongoDB are distributed databases. They store data across multiple nodes in a cluster.
Each node holds a portion of the data and often replicates that data to other nodes for redundancy and high availability.

Replication:
Data replication ensures that even if one node fails, the data is not lost because other nodes have copies.
What the Statement Means

Instance Store Usage:
An instance store is a type of storage physically attached to the host server (EC2 instance in AWS). It offers extremely low latency and high
performance compared to network-attached storage like EBS.
Instance stores are ephemeral, meaning their data is lost if the instance stops or the host fails.

How Instance Store is Used:

Databases like Cassandra or MongoDB can use instance stores for temporary, high-speed operations. 
For example:
Caching: Frequently accessed data can be stored on an instance store for faster reads.
Intermediate Data: Temporary results, like data being processed or written, can be stored here.
Replicated Data: Since these databases replicate data across multiple nodes, losing the instance store data on one node doesnâ€™t impact
the overall cluster's integrity. The data can be retrieved or reconstructed from other nodes in the cluster.

Why Use Instance Store?


Performance:
Access to instance stores is faster than accessing network-attached storage (like EBS), making it ideal for operations requiring quick reads and writes.

Cost-Effective:
Since the data is already replicated across nodes, persistent storage (which costs more) isnâ€™t always necessary for intermediate or replicated data.

Redundancy:
In distributed systems, losing data on one node (e.g., when the instance is stopped or fails) doesnâ€™t matter much because the same data exists on other nodes.

Example Use Case
Imagine a Cassandra cluster with three nodes:
Node A, Node B, and Node C.
Each node uses an instance store to store a copy of the replicated data for high-speed read/write operations.
If Node A fails, the data is lost on its instance store, but Nodes B and C still have copies of the data. When Node A is restored, it can quickly 
re-synchronize its data from Nodes B and C.

Key Takeaways
Instance stores provide temporary, high-speed storage for replicated data.
In distributed systems like Cassandra or MongoDB, the redundancy ensures that data loss on a single instance (or instance store) does not compromise the cluster.
Instance stores are not used for long-term storage in these scenarios but for performance optimization.
