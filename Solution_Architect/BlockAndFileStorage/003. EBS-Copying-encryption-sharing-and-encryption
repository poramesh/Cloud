EBS Volumes Overview

1. EBS (Elastic Block Store):
A type of block-based storage accessed over the network by EC2 instances.
Unlike network-attached file systems, EBS is still block-based storage.

2. Availability Zone (AZ) Bound:
EBS volumes exist in a specific Availability Zone (AZ) within a region.
They are accessed by EC2 instances over the network but cannot be directly moved to another AZ or region.


Snapshots

1. Definition:
A snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an EBS volume.
Stored in Amazon S3, which is a regional service.

2. Incremental Snapshots:
The first snapshot (e.g., Snap A) contains all the data on the volume.
Subsequent snapshots (e.g., Snap B, Snap C) only store changes since the previous snapshot.
Despite this, each snapshot can fully restore a volume.

3. Uses of Snapshots:
Backup: Safeguard data by creating snapshots at regular intervals.
Cross-AZ Movement: Create a volume from a snapshot in another AZ to move data.
Cross-Region Movement: Copy snapshots across regions and create volumes in the target region.
Create AMIs: Snapshots can be used to back AMIs for launching EC2 instances.


AMIs (Amazon Machine Images)

1. Definition:
An AMI is a template that includes:
An operating system.
Application server configurations.
Data volumes and other configurations.

2. Creation from Snapshots:
You can create an AMI from a snapshot.
The AMI can be used to launch EC2 instances in the same or a different AZ.

3. Sharing and Encryption:
Unencrypted AMIs can be shared publicly or with other accounts.
Encrypted AMIs require sharing the custom encryption key with the recipient account.



Encryption in EBS

1. Encrypted Snapshots and Volumes:
Snapshots and volumes can be encrypted for data security.
Encryption is retained during operations like copying or creating AMIs.

2. Options for Encryption:
Encrypt a volume while creating it from a snapshot.
Create an encrypted snapshot from an unencrypted one.
Use a custom encryption key for controlled access.

3. Sharing Restrictions:

Encrypted snapshots/AMIs:
Can be shared with other accounts if a custom key is shared.
Cannot be shared publicly.

Unencrypted snapshots/AMIs:
Can be shared publicly or with other accounts.



Copying and Sharing Snapshots/AMIs


Copying Snapshots:
Snapshots can be copied to:
Change regions.
Modify encryption state (e.g., encrypt an unencrypted snapshot).
Use a different encryption key.

Copying AMIs:
AMIs can be copied to:
Change regions.
Modify encryption keys.
Encrypted AMIs can only be shared with accounts that have access to the encryption key.


EC2 Instances and Volumes

Launching EC2 from AMIs:
EC2 instances can be created from both encrypted and unencrypted AMIs.
During launch, you can:
Change the encryption state of volumes.
Change the AZ of the instance.


Volume Creation from Snapshots:
Volumes can be created from snapshots in the same or a different AZ.
During creation, you can:
Change the encryption state.
Specify the AZ for the volume.
Key Points and Best Practices


Snapshots:
Keep only the latest snapshot to reduce storage costs.
Incremental backups save storage while retaining full restore capabilities.

Encryption:
Use custom encryption keys for controlled sharing.
Ensure that recipient accounts have access to the custom key if sharing encrypted resources.





V -> S :

We have a volume and we want to create a snapshot.
encryption state retained and it is in the same region and it is not within AZ now cause its almost free.

S ->Copy-> En S


If we take a snapshot and then we want to copy it and create an encrypted snapshot, we can do that.
And we now have an encrypted snapshot.
And while we do this, we can also optionally change the region in which we want the encrypted snapshot
to be created.

UEn S -> Enc V :

If we have an unencrypted snapshot, we can create an encrypted volume.
So at the time we create a volume from the snapshot, we can choose to encrypt it. And we can also change
the availability zone, but not the region.


Une S -> AMI :

If we have an unencrypted snapshot, we can also create an AMI.
However, it cannot be encrypted. When you create an AMI,
It's backed by the snapshot. So in other words, this AMI is connected to this snapshot and this is not encrypted, 
so the AMI can't be encrypted.
Now, you can share the AMI with other accounts, and you can even share it publicly as well.


S ->Copy-> S

We then have a snapshot and we want a copy to create another snapshot. In this case, we can change the
encryption key if it's encrypted and we can change regions. 


En S -> EN AMI

From an encrypted snapshot, we can create
an encrypted AMI. This can be shared with other accounts, but only if you have a custom encryption key.
Otherwise, they won't have access to your key, so they won't be able to read the data. And they cannot
be shared publicly.
So, if it's an unencrypted snapshot and you create an unencrypted AMI, it can be shared publicly.
But if it's encrypted, you can't share it in the public space. From an encrypted AMI, we can copy


Enc AMI ->Copy-> ENc AMI

From an encrypted AMI, we can copy it to create another encrypted AMI.
now, when we do that, we can change the encryption key.
So, if you wanted to share an encrypted AMI with another account, but you used a key, it wasn't a
custom key, then you can create a copy, change to a custom key, and then share that key with the account
and they'll be able to access that encrypted AMI.
You can also change the region as well. 

Enc AMI -> EC2 Instance

From an encrypted AMI, you can also create an EC2 instance. You can change the encryption key as you create the instance
and also the availability zone


Uenc AMI -> EC2 Insatnce

From an unencrypted AMI, you could create an EC2 instance. Again,
you can change the encryption state so you can encrypt it and change the availability zone.


Enc S -> Enc V

from an encrypted snapshot, you can create an encrypted volume and you can change
the availability zone as well if you want to.
