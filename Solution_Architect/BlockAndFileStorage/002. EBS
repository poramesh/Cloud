Introduction to EBS:

Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block-level storage service in AWS.
Primary Use: Provides persistent storage for EC2 instances, used for:
Operating system storage.
Storing application data.
Running databases and other workloads requiring high performance.

Key Characteristics of EBS:

Persistence:
EBS volumes persist independently of EC2 instances.
Data remains intact even after EC2 instance termination (unless specified otherwise).

AZ Specific:
EBS volumes are confined to a single Availability Zone (AZ).
The data is replicated within the AZ for durability and fault tolerance.

Attachment:
EBS volumes must be attached to an EC2 instance in the same AZ.
Volumes can be attached/detached dynamically.

Snapshots:
Snapshots of EBS volumes can be created and stored in Amazon S3.
Snapshots can be used to create new volumes in the same or different AZs or regions.


^^^
Snapshot Basics:
Point-in-time backup: A snapshot is essentially a backup of the data on an EBS volume at a specific point in time.
Incremental snapshots: After the initial snapshot, AWS only saves the changes (deltas) to the volume data rather than duplicating the entire volume. 
This makes subsequent snapshots more efficient in terms of storage space.

EBS Volume Types:
EBS volumes are categorized into SSD-backed and HDD-backed types:


1. SSD-Backed Volumes:
Designed for high performance and low latency.
Suitable for workloads requiring fast IOPS (e.g., databases, OS disks).

Type:	gp2 (General Purpose SSD)
Volume Size: 1 GiB to 16 TiB	
Max IOPS(input output per sec):	16,000
Multi-Attach:	:No
Use Case: General-purpose workloads.

Type:	gp3
Volume Size: 1 GiB to 16 TiB	
Max IOPS:	16,000
Multi-Attach:No
Use Case: Cost-efficient, configurable IOPS, Web servers, boot volumes, low-latency applications.

Type:	io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)
Volume Size: 4 GiB to 16 TiB	
Max IOPS:	64,000	
Multi-Attach:	:Yes
Use Case: I/O-intensive workloads or IOPS-intensive applications.


Type:	io2 (provisioned)
Volume Soze: 4 GiB to 16 TiB	
Max IOPS:	256,000
Multi-Attach:	:Yes
Use Case: Higher durability, critical application, latency-sensitive applications.

Type:	io2 Block Express (provisioned)
Volume Size: 4 GiB to 64 TiB	
Max IOPS:	256,000
Multi-Attach:	:Yes
Use Case: Extreme performance and scalability.

###Provisioned refers to reserving or allocating specific resources in advance to meet a desired performance level or capacity. In the context of storage,
computing, or networking, it ensures that the allocated resource is available for use whenever needed.###

2. HDD-Backed Volumes:
Ideal for sequential read/write operations and large data sets.
Cost-effective compared to SSD-backed volumes.

Type: st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)
Volume Size: 500 GiB to 16 TiB	
Max IOPS: 500
Multi-Attach: No
Use Case: Big data, log processing.

^^^^
what is throughput:
Throughput is the rate at which data is read from or written to the storage.
It is measured in megabytes per second (MB/s).
This volume type is ideal for applications that require transferring large amounts of data sequentially, such as log processing, data lakes, or video streaming.

Imagine you're running a log analytics pipeline that processes logs sequentially from multiple servers. Each log file is hundreds of MBs in size, 
and you need to transfer and analyze them quickly but not in a random order. Throughput-Optimized HDD volumes would be an ideal choice since 
they provide cost-effective high-throughput storage without the need for high IOPS.
^^^^^^


Type: sc1 (Cold HDD)	
Volume size: 500 GiB to 16 TiB	
Max IOPS: 250
Multi-Attach:	No	
USe case: Infrequently accessed data, scenarios where low storage cost is imp


Key Concepts:

1. EBS Multi-Attach:
Allows a single EBS volume to be attached to multiple EC2 instances.
Constraints:
Only supported for Nitro-based EC2 instances.
Limited to io1, io2, and io2 Block Express volumes.
Max of 16 instances can be attached to the same volume.
All instances and the volume must be in the same AZ.
Use Case: Shared workloads like clustered databases or applications.

2. Durability and Availability:
Data is replicated within the AZ for durability.
Ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

3. Partitioning and File System:
Once a volume is created, it can be partitioned and formatted with a file system.
Common file systems: NTFS (Windows), EXT4 (Linux), etc.

4. Lifecycle of EBS Volumes:
Root Volumes:
Default: Deleted when the EC2 instance is terminated.
This behavior can be modified.
Additional Volumes:
Persist after instance termination by default.
Behavior can also be changed.

****
Volumes and Deletion on EC2 Instance Termination:
Boot Volume: By default, the boot volume (which contains the OS) is deleted when you terminate the
instance. However, this behavior can be modified.
Non-Boot Volumes: Non-boot volumes typically do not get deleted when the instance is terminated, and you need to manage them separately. Again,
this behavior can be configured when creating or attaching the volume.




Boot Volume: When you launch an EC2 instance, AWS automatically creates a boot volume based on the AMI you choose. 
This volume has the OS installed and is required to launch the instance.
Non-Boot Volume: After launching the instance, you might add extra EBS volumes (non-boot volumes) to store application data. 
For example, if you're running a database application on your instance, you might attach a non-boot EBS volume to store the database files.
*******



Final notes:

>The EBS volumes persist independently of the life of an EC2 instance,

>EBS Volumes don't need to be attached to an EC2 instance. So they can exist in AWS without actually being attached to an EC2 instance.

>you can boot up an instance or attach them to an existing instance.

>You can have multiple EBS volumes attached to a single EC2 instance.

>EBS volumes absolutely must be in the same availability zone as the instances they are attached to.

>By default, the root EBS volumes,those are the ones with your operating system,get deleted on termination of the instance by default.
However, any non-boot volumes, so any additional volumes that you attach to your EC2 instanc do not get deleted on termination by default.
And in both of these cases, you can change this behavior.






what is latency?

Latency is the time it takes for a system to respond to a request. In the context of storage systems, it refers to the delay between a request
(e.g., reading or writing data) and the completion of that request.

Key Points about Latency
1. Measured in milliseconds (ms) or microseconds (µs):
A lower latency indicates a faster response.
For example, if a storage drive has a latency of 1 ms, it takes 1 millisecond to complete a single read or write operation.

2. Components of Latency:
Access Time:
The time needed to locate the data.
Includes seek time (for HDDs) or accessing memory cells (for SSDs).
Transfer Time:
The time required to transfer the data after it has been located.
Queue Time:
The time a request spends waiting in the queue before being processed.

3. Type of Storage:
Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) typically have higher latency due to mechanical components like spinning platters and moving read/write heads.
Solid-State Drives (SSDs) have lower latency because they use electronic memory with no moving parts.

4. Network Distance:
For network-attached storage (e.g., NAS), the physical distance and network speed can impact latency.

5. Concurrency:
When multiple requests are made simultaneously, queue times may increase, leading to higher latency.


Examples of Latency
1. HDD: Latency is typically in the range of 5-10 ms due to the time it takes for the spinning platter and read/write head to align.

2. SSD: Latency is significantly lower, often less than 1 ms because data access is electronic.

3. AWS EBS:
General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3): ~1 ms latency.
Throughput-Optimized HDD (st1): ~5-10 ms latency.
Cold HDD (sc1): ~10-15 ms latency.

Latency vs. Throughput
Latency: Measures how quickly a single request is completed.
Throughput: Measures the amount of data transferred in a given time (e.g., MB/s).

Example:
A high-latency storage system might take longer to process a single request, even if it can handle large volumes of data once started.
Conversely, a low-latency system is better for applications requiring quick responses, like real-time databases.

Why Does Latency Matter?

Performance:
Low latency is critical for applications like real-time analytics, transactional databases, and gaming.
High latency can slow down workflows and degrade user experience.

Efficiency:
In high-demand environments, reducing latency ensures faster completion of tasks, improving overall system throughput.







What is Throughput?

Throughput refers to the amount of data that can be transferred from one location to another within a given period of time. It is typically measured
in units such as megabytes per second (MB/s), gigabytes per second (GB/s), or bits per second (bps) for networks.

In the context of storage systems, throughput measures how much data can be read or written to a storage device per second.


Key Characteristics of Throughput

1. Measures Data Transfer Rate:
Throughput reflects the overall capacity of a system to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
For example, a system with 500 MB/s throughput can read or write 500 megabytes of data per second.

2. Different from Latency:
Latency: How fast a single request is processed.
Throughput: How much data is processed over time.
Example: A system may have low latency for small files but lower throughput when dealing with large files.

3. Applications of High Throughput:
Suitable for workloads requiring bulk data transfers, such as:
Big data analytics.
Video streaming or rendering.
Data backups and archiving.




Throughput in AWS EBS Volumes

AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides different volume types, each optimized for specific workloads:

General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3):
Balanced performance.
Throughput: 250–1000 MB/s (depending on volume size and type).

Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1/io2):
Designed for low latency and high IOPS.
Throughput: up to 1024 MB/s.

Throughput-Optimized HDD (st1):
Designed for high throughput rather than high IOPS.
Throughput: up to 500 MB/s.

Cold HDD (sc1):
Low-cost option for infrequent access.
Throughput: up to 250 MB/s.




Factors That Influence Throughput

Storage Type:
HDDs typically have lower throughput compared to SSDs.
Network-attached storage (NAS) may have throughput limits based on network speed.

File Size:
Large, sequential files often achieve higher throughput compared to small, random files.

Network Bandwidth:
For data transfer across a network, the available network bandwidth directly impacts throughput.

Concurrent Access:
Throughput may decrease if multiple applications are reading/writing to the same storage simultaneously.




Why Does Throughput Matter?

Workload Efficiency:
For tasks like video editing or data streaming, high throughput ensures data moves quickly without bottlenecks.

Performance Optimization:
Matching the storage throughput to the workload ensures efficient resource utilization.




Throughput vs. IOPS

IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):
Measures how many input/output operations are performed in a second.
Relevant for small, random reads/writes (e.g., databases).

Throughput:
Measures the volume of data transferred per second.
Relevant for large, sequential reads/writes (e.g., big data analytics).





Real-World Example of Throughput


Scenario: Video Streaming Platform
Imagine you are running a video streaming platform (like Netflix or YouTube). Your platform needs to deliver video
files quickly to users, especially during peak hours.

1. Storage System:
Videos are stored on an AWS EBS Throughput-Optimized HDD (st1) volume, which is ideal for handling large, sequential data transfers.
Each video file might be several gigabytes in size.

2. Throughput in Action:
When a user requests a video, the system reads chunks of the video from storage.
If the EBS volume has a throughput of 500 MB/s, it can deliver a large 2 GB video file in about 4 seconds (2000 MB ÷ 500 MB/s).

3. High Throughput Advantage:
Multiple users can stream videos simultaneously without noticeable lag or buffering because the system 
can transfer large amounts of data quickly.



How to Optimize Throughput in AWS

1. Choose the Right Volume Type:
For workloads requiring high throughput, use Throughput-Optimized HDD (st1) or gp3 SSD volumes.

2. Configure Proper Block Size:
Larger block sizes (e.g., 1 MB) improve throughput for large, sequential files.
Small block sizes (e.g., 4 KB) may lead to lower throughput due to higher overhead.

3. Enable Enhanced Networking:
Use Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) for EC2 instances to increase network bandwidth and support higher 
throughput for network-attached storage.

4. Parallel Reads/Writes:
Applications should use multiple threads or processes to read/write data concurrently to maximize throughput.

5. Monitor and Scale:
Use AWS CloudWatch to monitor throughput metrics and adjust volume size or type if required.
Scale out by adding more instances or storage volumes for distributed access.

 If cost is a significant factor and you’re dealing with large amounts of sequential data, HDDs are a good choice. For high-performance, latency-sensitive applications, 
SSDs are the way to go.
