1. A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the 
company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. 
The solution must minimize operational complexity.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.
B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.
C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region
Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.



A. is correct because S3 Transfer Acceleration is support for high speed transfer in Edge location and you can upload it immediately.
Also with multipart uploads your big file can be uploaded in parallel.
B, C, D. is not minimize operational and fast when compare to answer A

what is transfer accelaration?
Uses CloudFront edge locations to speed up uploads.
Reduces latency by using a geographically closer edge location for uploading.
Best for remote locations far from the S3 bucket.

2. A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Use Amazon Redshift to load all the content into one place and run the SQL queries as needed.
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store the logs. Run SQL queries as needed from the Amazon CloudWatch console.
C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed. Most Voted
D. Use AWS Glue to catalog the logs. Use a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR to run the SQL queries as needed.

C is correct, Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using
standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard 
SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.

3. A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that
contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.
B. Create an organizational unit (OU) for each department. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.
C. Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the CreateAccount, InviteAccountToOrganization, LeaveOrganization, and RemoveAccountFromOrganization 
events. Update the S3 bucket policy accordingly.
D. Tag each user that needs access to the S3 bucket. Add the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.



aws:PrincipalOrgID Validates if the principal accessing the resource belongs to an account in your organization.

4. An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs 
to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet.
Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.
B. Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket.
C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access.
D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint.


answer is A 
If accessing S3/DynamoDB privately: Use a Gateway VPC Endpoint.
If accessing any other AWS service privately: Use an Interface Endpoint (via PrivateLink).
If accessing third-party SaaS applications or services in another account/VPC: Use PrivateLink


((((((
There are two main types of VPC Endpoints:
Gateway Endpoint
Works only for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
Uses route tables to direct traffic.
Free to use (no data transfer costs).

Interface Endpoint
Works for most AWS services (e.g., SSM, Secrets Manager, EC2 API, Lambda, etc.).
Uses AWS PrivateLink (creates an elastic network interface inside the VPC).
Not free – incurs per-hour and data processing charges.

5. A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. 
For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, 
placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they 
could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?

A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents
B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server



Ebs doesnt support cross az only reside in one Az but Efs does, that why it's c

here we start off by copying the current data from ebs to efs and now we modify it to save directly in the amaozn efs.

6. A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. 
The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video 
files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an S3 bucket. Create an IAM role that has permissions to write to the S3 bucket. Use the AWS CLI to copy
all files locally to the S3 bucket.
B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return 
the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.
C. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public service endpoint to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new
NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.
D. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public
virtual interface (VIF) to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new
file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.

sol:
B. On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less 
than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send
it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.

C. File Gateway uses the Internet, so maximum speed will be at most 1Gbps, so it'll take a minimum of 6.5 days and you use 70TB of Internet bandwidth.

D. You can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbps with Direct Connect. Total time 15.5 hours and you will use 70TB of bandwidth. However, what's
interesting is that the question does not specific what type of bandwidth? Direct Connect does not use your Internet bandwidth, as you will 
have a dedicate peer to peer connectivity between your on-prem and the AWS Cloud, so technically, you're not using your "public" bandwidth.

The requirements are a bit too vague but I think that B is the most appropriate answer, although D might also be correct if the bandwidth usage
refers strictly to your public connectivity.


Capacities and Scales of snowball:
Snowball: 50-80 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowball Edge: 100 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowmobile: Up to 100 petabytes (exabyte scale).
snowcone: less than 8 TB

7. A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages.
The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second.
The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.
B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.
C. Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages 
and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages.
D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions.
Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

ans: 
Amazon SNS + SQS provides a scalable and decoupled architecture:
SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service that allows the ingestion application to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers.
SQS acts as the subscriber to the SNS topic, creating separate message queues for each consumer application. This ensures:
Scalability: Messages are distributed across queues, decoupling the producer and consumers.
Reliability: SQS queues store messages until consumer applications can process them, accommodating sudden spikes in message volume.

8. A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary
server that coordinates jobs across multiple compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes resiliency and scalability.
How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?

A. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances 
that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling to use scheduled scaling.
B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances 
that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.
C. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure AWS CloudTrail
as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the primary server.
D. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure Amazon EventBridge
(Amazon CloudWatch Events) as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the compute nodes.

ans:
1.Amazon SQS for Decoupling:
Amazon SQS provides a fully managed message queue to decouple the primary server from the compute nodes. Jobs are sent to the queue, and
compute nodes process them independently.
This architecture eliminates a single point of failure (the primary server) and increases resilience.

2.Auto Scaling Group for Compute Nodes:
EC2 instances managed in an Auto Scaling group process the jobs in the SQS queue. Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of 
instances based on the queue size, ensuring scalability to handle variable workloads.

3.Scalability Based on Queue Size:
Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue ensures that the system adjusts to workload demands efficiently. When the queue grows,
more instances are launched; when the queue shrinks, instances are terminated.


C, D - incorrect: Primary server should not be in same Auto Scaling group with compute nodes.
ASGs are designed for stateless, replaceable compute nodes (e.g., web servers, worker nodes).
If an instance in an ASG fails or is unhealthy, the ASG automatically terminates and replaces it.
Problem: If the primary server (e.g., a database or stateful service) is in the ASG, it could be unintentionally terminated and replaced, leading to data loss or service disruption.
✅ Best Practice: The primary server should be a separate dedicated instance or managed service (e.g., Amazon RDS for databases).

Compute nodes (web servers, worker nodes, etc.) are stateless, meaning they process tasks without storing persistent data.
Primary servers (databases, controllers, etc.) are stateful, meaning they maintain critical data and connections.
Problem: If the primary server is in an ASG, it may be terminated and restarted without preserving its state, leading to data corruption.

9. A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few 
days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.
The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available 
storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle
management to avoid future storage issues.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.
B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data
to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days. Most Voted
C. Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system to extend the company's storage space.
D. Install a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 
Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.



ans:
Correct answer is B.
Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud to store application data files and backup images as durable 
objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage. Amazon S3 File Gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.
It can be used for on-premises data-intensive Amazon EC2-based applications that need file protocol access to S3 object storage. 
Lifecycle policies can then transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

The S3 File Gateway allows you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using standard file system protocols, such as SMB and NFS.
This would provide additional storage space for the company's data and allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files,
as the data would still be stored on the SMB file server.

Option A, using AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS, would not provide additional storage space
for the company's data and would not allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files.

Option C, creating an FSx for Windows File Server file system, would provide additional storage space but would not include file lifecycle management.

Option D, installing a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3 and creating an S3 Lifecycle policy, would not 
provide additional storage space on the company's file server.

10. A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST
API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use an API Gateway integration to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the application receives an order. 
Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the topic to perform processing.
B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order.
Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.
C. Use an API Gateway authorizer to block any requests while the application processes an order.
D. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue when the application receives an order.
Configure the SQS standard queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

11. A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database
by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.
B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation.
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store objects that are encrypted with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Migrate the credential 
file to the S3 bucket. Point the application to the S3 bucket.
D. Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for each EC2 instance. Attach the new EBS volume to each EC2 instance. Migrate 
the credential file to the new EBS volume. Point the application to the new EBS volume.



ans:
B is wrong because parameter store does not support auto rotation, unless the customer writes it themselves, A is the answer.

12. A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and 
dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and 
dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route
53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the 
S3 bucket as an endpoint Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has 
the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name 
as an endpoint for the web application.
D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint.
Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS 
name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.


ans:
Answer is A
Explanation - AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
• They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
• Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
CloudFront
• Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
• Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
• Content is served at the edge
Global Accelerator
• Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
• Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
• Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
• Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
• Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

14. A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon 
EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. 
The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.
The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions.
The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality.
B. Use Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment Configure Amazon RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone.
C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances.


ans: 
C, AURORA is 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS and handles more read requests than write,; maintaining high availability = Multi-AZ deployment

Option C, using Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment and configuring Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas,
would be the best solution to meet the requirements.
Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL-compatible relational database that is designed for high performance and high availability. 
Aurora Multi-AZ deployments automatically maintain a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone to provide
high availability. Additionally, Aurora Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale the number of Aurora Replicas in response to read workloads, 
allowing you to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability. This would provide an automated solution
for scaling the database to meet the demand of the application while maintaining high availability.

Option A, using Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality, would not provide high availability.
Option B, using Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment and configuring RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone, would not 
provide high availability and would not automatically scale the number of reader instances in response to read workloads.
Option D, using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances, would not provide a database solution and would not meet the requirements

15. A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out of the production VPC. 
The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as traffic flow inspection 
and traffic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon GuardDuty for traffic inspection and traffic filtering in the production VPC.
B. Use Traffic Mirroring to mirror traffic from the production VPC for traffic inspection and filtering.
C. Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
D. Use AWS Firewall Manager to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.



ans:
option C: Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
AWS Network Firewall is a managed firewall service that provides filtering for both inbound and outbound network traffic. 
It allows you to create rules for traffic inspection and filtering, which can help protect your production VPC.

Option A: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service, not a traffic inspection or filtering service.
Option B: Traffic Mirroring is a feature that allows you to replicate and send a copy of network traffic from a VPC to another VPC or 
on-premises location. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.
Option D: AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps you to centrally configure and manage firewalls 
across your accounts. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.

16. A company hosts a data lake on AWS. The data lake consists of data in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The company needs a reporting 
solution that provides data visualization and includes all the data sources within the data lake. Only the company's management team should
have full access to all the visualizations. The rest of the company should have only limited access.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. 
Share the dashboards with the appropriate IAM roles.
B. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. 
Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups.
C. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Create an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to produce reports.
Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.
D. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena Federated Query to access data within Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 
Generate reports by using Amazon Athena. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.


ans:
The question requires a solution for data visualization, which means it focuses solely on downstream consumption. Therefore, any solution that
includes upstream processing is off the table (C & D). This leaves us with two options: A and B. Essentially, they are the same with one 
key difference: A manages access through IAM Roles, while B manages it through an IAM group. Since only the management team is granted 
permission, using a group will be more efficient, as it scales better with changes in personnel and provides a centralized point for managing permissions.

Keyword: data visualization = QuickSight
QuickSight defines Users (standard versions) and Groups (enterprise version)
These users & groups only exist within QuickSight, not IAM
So the correct answer is B.

A - Incorrect: Amazon QuickSight only support users(standard version) and groups (enterprise version). users and groups 
only exists without QuickSight. QuickSight don't support IAM. We use users and groups to view the QuickSight dashboard
B - Correct: as explained in answer A and QuickSight is used to created dashboard from S3, RDS, Redshift,
Aurora, Athena, OpenSearch, Timestream
C - Incorrect: This way don't support visulization and don't mention how to process RDS data
D - Incorrect: This way don't support visulization and don't mention how to combine data RDS and S3

17. A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an
Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.
B. Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances.
C. Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances.
D. Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances.

ans:
The correct option to meet this requirement is A: Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and attach the role to the EC2 instances.
An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role
that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the
S3 bucket and the documents stored within it.

Option B is incorrect because an IAM policy is used to define permissions for an IAM user or group, not for an EC2 instance.
Option C is incorrect because an IAM group is used to group together IAM users and policies, not to grant access to resources.
Option D is incorrect because an IAM user is used to represent a person or service that interacts with AWS resources, not to grant access to resources.

Always remember that you should associate IAM roles to EC2 instances

18. An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images.
When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and 
compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue 
when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source.
When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name
to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, 
log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an 
Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.


ans:
To design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process images automatically, a solutions architect could consider the following actions:
Option A involves creating an SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send a notification to the queue when an image is uploaded. 
This allows the application to decouple the image upload process from the image processing process and ensures that the image processing
process is triggered automatically when a new image is uploaded.
Option B involves configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed,
the message is deleted from the queue. This ensures that the Lambda function is invoked only once per image and that the image is not processed multiple times.
Option C is incorrect because it involves storing state (the file name) in memory, which is not a durable or scalable solution.
Option D is incorrect because it involves launching an EC2 instance to monitor the SQS queue, which is not a stateless solution.
Option E is incorrect because it involves using Amazon EventBridge (formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an alert to an Amazon Simple
Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, which is not related to the image processing process.

The application servers and database servers are deployed in private subnets in the same VPC. The company has deployed a third-party 
virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC. The appliance is configured with an IP interface that can accept IP packets.
A solutions architect needs to integrate the web application with the appliance to inspect all traffic to the application before the traffic reaches the web server.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create a Network Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
B. Create an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
C. Deploy a transit gateway in the inspection VPConfigure route tables to route the incoming packets through the transit gateway.
D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming 
packets and forward the packets to the appliance.


ans:
D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive 
the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

A Gateway Load Balancer can inspect traffic before forwarding it to a virtual appliance for additional processing. 
The solution will not require changing the existing architecture and will have the least amount of operational overhead.
The appliance can be configured with a specific IP interface to accept IP packets. The Gateway Load Balancer can be configured
with an endpoint to route incoming packets to the appliance. The solution ensures all traffic to the web application is inspected before it reaches the web server.


Keywords:Third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC -> only Gateway Load Balancer support it

A: Incorrect - Network Load Balancer don't support to route traffic to third-party virtual firewall appliance.
B: Incorrect - Application Load Balancer don't support to route traffic to third-party virtual firewall appliance.
C: Incorrect - Transit Gateway is use as connect center to connect all VPC, Direct Connect Gateway and VPN Connection. Routes Tables 
in Trasit Gateway only limit which VPC can talk to other VPCs.
D: Correct - Gateway Load Balancer support route traffic to third-party virtual firewall appliance in layer 3 that make it different from ALB and NLB.

20. A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is 
stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not 
affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.
A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Restore the snapshots onto EC2 instance store volumes in the test environment.
B. Configure the production EBS volumes to use the EBS Multi-Attach feature. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. 
Attach the production EBS volumes to the EC2 instances in the test environment.
C. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Create and initialize new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 
instances in the test environment before restoring the volumes from the production EBS snapshots.
D. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. 
Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.


ans: 
Keywords:
- Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment.
- Minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.

A: Incorrect - we can do this But it is not minimize the time as requirement.
B: Incorrect - This approach use same EBS volumes for produciton and test. If we modify test then it
will be affected prodution environment.
C: Incorrect - EBS snapshot will create new EBS volumes. It can not restore from existing volumes.
D: Correct - Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots -> no latency on first use

21. An ecommerce company wants to launch a one-deal-a-day website on AWS. Each day will feature exactly one product on sale for a period of 24 hours. 
The company wants to be able to handle millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency during peak hours.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use Amazon S3 to host the full website in different S3 buckets. Add Amazon CloudFront distributions. Set the S3 buckets as origins 
for the distributions. Store the order data in Amazon S3.
B. Deploy the full website on Amazon EC2 instances that run in Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones. Add an Application
Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute the website traffic. Add another ALB for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.
C. Migrate the full application to run in containers. Host the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use the
Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to increase and decrease the number of pods to process bursts in traffic. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.
D. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. 
Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.


ans: DynamoDB is only suitable because of its really fast milliseconds speed.
the solution that will meet these requirements with the least operational overhead is D: Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's 
static content, deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution, set the S3 bucket as the origin, and use Amazon API Gateway and AWS 
Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

Using Amazon S3 to host static content and Amazon CloudFront to distribute the content can provide high performance and scale for websites with millions of 
requests each hour. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda can be used to build scalable and highly available backend APIs to support the website, and Amazon
DynamoDB can be used to store the data. This solution requires minimal operational overhead as it leverages fully managed services that automatically scale to meet demand.

Option A is incorrect because using multiple S3 buckets to host the full website would not provide the required performance and 
scale for millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency.
Option B is incorrect because deploying the full website on EC2 instances and using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an RDS
database would require more operational overhead to maintain and scale the infrastructure.
Option C is incorrect because while deploying the application in containers and hosting them on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes 
Service (EKS) can provide high performance and scale, it would require more operational overhead to maintain and scale the
infrastructure compared to using fully managed services like S3 and CloudFront.

22. A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be 
resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. 
The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files.
Which storage option meets these requirements?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
C. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
D. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)


ans:
The storage option that meets these requirements is B: S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based 
on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent
access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is
optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.

S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable 
pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and 
retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region.

23. A company observes an increase in Amazon EC2 costs in its most recent bill. The billing team notices unwanted vertical scaling of instance 
types for a couple of EC2 instances. A solutions architect needs to create a graph comparing the last 2 months of EC2 costs and perform an
in-depth analysis to identify the root cause of the vertical scaling.
How should the solutions architect generate the information with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use AWS Budgets to create a budget report and compare EC2 costs based on instance types.
B. Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.
C. Use graphs from the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard to compare EC2 costs based on instance types for the last 2 months.
D. Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report and send it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon S3 as a source to generate an
interactive graph based on instance types.


ans:
Cost Explorer, AWS prepares the data about your costs for the current month and the last 12 months, and then calculates the forecast 
for the next 12 months. The current month's data is available for viewing in about 24 hours. The rest of your data takes a few days 
longer. Cost Explorer updates your cost data at least once every 24 hour.

24. A company is storing backup files by using Amazon S3 Standard storage. The files are accessed frequently for 1 month. However,
the files are not accessed after 1 month. The company must keep the files indefinitely.
Which storage solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects.
B. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.
C. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month.
D. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month.


ans:
The storage solution that will meet these requirements most cost-effectively is B: Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects 
from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for long-term retention of data that
is rarely accessed and for which retrieval times of several hours are acceptable. It is the lowest-cost storage option in Amazon S3, making 
it a cost-effective choice for storing backup files that are not accessed after 1 month.
You can use an S3 Lifecycle configuration to automatically transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month. 
This will minimize the storage costs for the backup files that are not accessed frequently.

Option A, configuring S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects, is not a good choice because it is not designed
for long-term storage and does not offer the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Option C, transitioning objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month, is not a good 
choice because it is not the lowest-cost storage option and would not provide the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Option D, transitioning objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month, is not a good 
choice because it is not the lowest-cost storage option and would not provide the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.




Storage Class                      	Examples of Data Stored

25. A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and 
to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.
During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes 
of data that the company needs to load into the database. A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve 
scalability and minimize the configuration effort.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Refactor the Lambda function code to Apache Tomcat code that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Connect the database 
by using native Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers.
B. Change the platform from Aurora to Amazon DynamoDProvision a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Use the DAX client
SDK to point the existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster.
C. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information 
into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into
the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

Current Flow:
Users send data → API Gateway receives it → Lambda processes it → Data is stored in Aurora.

During the proof-of-concept (PoC) phase, the company realizes that:
High volumes of data are being received.
AWS Lambda quotas (memory, execution time, concurrency limits) are not enough to handle the load.
Direct writes from Lambda to Aurora are inefficient, causing scalability issues (e.g., too many connections to the database).
The company now needs a better design that:
✔ Improves scalability (handles large amounts of data).
✔ Minimizes configuration effort (automates as much as possible).

Current Problem:
The single Lambda function is overloaded due to high-volume data ingestion and direct writes to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.
AWS Lambda has concurrency limits, and too many database connections can slow down Aurora.

New Proposed Solution (Option D)
Lambda Function 1 (Data Receiver)
This function receives data from API Gateway.
Instead of directly inserting data into Aurora, it places the data in an Amazon SQS queue.

Amazon SQS (Buffer Layer)
Stores incoming messages temporarily.
Decouples the receiving process from database writing.
Handles traffic spikes and prevents database overload.

Lambda Function 2 (Data Loader)
Reads messages from Amazon SQS in batches.
Processes and loads the data into Aurora PostgreSQL efficiently.

ans:
It could be C or D, but Ans D wins because
–SNS is Push Mechanism - ‘Other Lambda’ function is forced to take message when it might not be ready (or refuse it)
–SQS is Pull Mechanism – ‘Other Lambda’ function can take next message when its ready to do so
SQS is simple and allows better de-coupling.

26. A company needs to review its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure that its Amazon S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.
B. Turn on AWS Trusted Advisor with the appropriate checks.
C. Turn on Amazon Inspector with the appropriate assessment template.
D. Turn on Amazon S3 server access logging. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon Cloud Watch Events).


sol: The solution that will accomplish this goal is A: Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.
AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
You can use AWS Config to monitor and record changes to the configuration of your Amazon S3 buckets. By turning on
AWS Config and enabling the appropriate rules, you can ensure that your S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.
   
AWS Trusted Advisor (Option B) is a service that provides best practice recommendations for your AWS resources, but it does not 
monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 buckets.
Amazon Inspector (Option C) is a service that helps you assess the security and compliance of your applications. While it 
can be used to assess the security of your S3 buckets, it does not monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 buckets.
Amazon S3 server access logging (Option D) enables you to log requests made to your S3 bucket. While it can help you identify changes to your S3 bucket,
it does not monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 bucket.

27. A company is launching a new application and will display application metrics on an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard. The company's product 
manager needs to access this dashboard periodically. The product manager does not have an AWS account. A solutions architect must provide access 
to the product manager by following the principle of least privilege.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Share the dashboard from the CloudWatch console. Enter the product manager's email address, and complete the sharing steps. Provide a shareable
link for the dashboard to the product manager.
B. Create an IAM user specifically for the product manager. Attach the CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the user. Share the new
login credentials with the product manager. Share the browser URL of the correct dashboard with the product manager.
C. Create an IAM user for the company's employees. Attach the ViewOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the IAM user. Share the new login credentials with 
the product manager. Ask the product manager to navigate to the CloudWatch console and locate the dashboard by name in the Dashboards section.
D. Deploy a bastion server in a public subnet. When the product manager requires access to the dashboard, start the server and share the RDP credentials.
On the bastion server, ensure that the browser is configured to open the dashboard URL with cached AWS credentials that have appropriate permissions to view the dashboard.


sol:
option b has a problem for cloudwatchreadonlyacess policy, it’s not only grant read access to dashboard, but other read permission
for logs, insights, etc. so it does not follows the principle of least privilege. Option A only grants access to dashboard.
ans is a, Share a single dashboard and designate specific email addresses of the people who can view the dashboard. Each of these users creates 
their own password that they must enter to view the dashboard.

28. A company is migrating applications to AWS. The applications are deployed in different accounts. The company manages the accounts
centrally by using AWS Organizations. The company's security team needs a single sign-on (SSO) solution across all the company's accounts.
The company must continue managing the users and groups in its on-premises self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console. Create a one-way forest trust or a one-way domain trust to connect the 
company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory with AWS SSO by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
B. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console. Create a two-way forest trust to connect the company's self-managed Microsoft
Active Directory with AWS SSO by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
C. Use AWS Directory Service. Create a two-way trust relationship with the company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.
D. Deploy an identity provider (IdP) on premises. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console.



sol: Tricky question!!! forget one-way or two-way. In this scenario, AWS applications (Amazon Chime, Amazon Connect, Amazon QuickSight, 
AWS Single Sign-On, Amazon WorkDocs, Amazon WorkMail, Amazon WorkSpaces, AWS Client VPN, AWS Management Console, and AWS Transfer Family) need to 
be able to look up objects from the on-premises domain in order for them to function. This tells you that authentication needs to
flow both ways. This scenario requires a two-way trust between the on-premises and AWS Managed Microsoft AD domains.
It is a requirement of the application
Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and Amazon FSx will work with either a one-way or two-way trust.

AWS IAM Identity Center requires a two-way trust so that it has permissions to read user and group information from your domain 
to synchronize user and group metadata. IAM Identity Center uses this metadata when assigning access to permission sets or applications. 
User and group metadata is also used by applications for collaboration, like when you share a dashboard with another user or group. 
The trust from AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory to your domain permits IAM Identity Center to trust your domain for authentication.
The trust in the opposite direction grants AWS permissions to read user and group metadata.

29. A company provides a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service that uses UDP connections. The service consists of Amazon EC2 instances 
that run in an Auto Scaling group. The company has deployments across multiple AWS Regions.
The company needs to route users to the Region with the lowest latency. The company also needs automated failover between Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group.
Use the NLB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
B. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling 
group. Use the ALB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
C. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. 
Create an Amazon Route 53 latency record that points to aliases for each NLB. Create an Amazon CloudFront 
distribution that uses the latency record as an origin.
D. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. 
Create an Amazon Route 53 weighted record that points to aliases for each ALB. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront 
distribution that uses the weighted record as an origin.


sol: A - Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as
well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.
Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
CloudFront uses Edge Locations to cache content while Global Accelerator uses Edge Locations to find an optimal pathway to the
nearest regional endpoint. CloudFront is designed to handle HTTP protocol meanwhile Global Accelerator is best used for both HTTP
and non-HTTP protocols such as TCP and UDP. so i think A is a better answer

30. A development team runs monthly resource-intensive tests on its general purpose Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Performance Insights enabled. 
The testing lasts for 48 hours once a month and is the only process that uses the database. The team wants to reduce the cost of 
running the tests without reducing the compute and memory attributes of the DB instance.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Stop the DB instance when tests are completed. Restart the DB instance when required.
B. Use an Auto Scaling policy with the DB instance to automatically scale when tests are completed.
C. Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.
D. Modify the DB instance to a low-capacity instance when tests are completed. Modify the DB instance again when required.


real world ex: Imagine a software testing company that runs load tests on a MySQL database once a month to:
Simulate high user traffic on a new application.
Analyze database performance under stress.
Ensure the application can handle peak loads.

and 🔹 Without a snapshot? They would lose all database configurations and data, forcing them to manually recreate the database each time, which is inefficient.



sol: The correct answer is: C. Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.
Explanation:
This solution is the most cost-effective because it allows the development team to:
Save Costs by Terminating the Instance:
When the DB instance is not in use (28 out of 30 days), terminating it eliminates the costs associated with running a live instance.
You only pay for storage costs associated with the snapshot, which is significantly lower than the cost of keeping a running instance.

Restoring a Snapshot:
Restoring from a snapshot is straightforward and brings the database back with the same data and configuration as before.
It’s a good practice when dealing with periodic, resource-intensive tasks like the monthly tests.

31. A company that hosts its web application on AWS wants to ensure all Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon RDS DB instances. and Amazon Redshift clusters
are configured with tags. The company wants to minimize the effort of configuring and operating this check.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?

A. Use AWS Config rules to define and detect resources that are not properly tagged. Most Voted
B. Use Cost Explorer to display resources that are not properly tagged. Tag those resources manually.
C. Write API calls to check all resources for proper tag allocation. Periodically run the code on an EC2 instance.
D. Write API calls to check all resources for proper tag allocation. Schedule an AWS Lambda function through Amazon CloudWatch to periodically run the code.



ans: Yes, you can use AWS Config to create tags for your resources. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess,
audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. You can use AWS Config to create rules that automatically tag
resources when they are created or when their configurations change.

To create tags for your resources using AWS Config, you will need to create an AWS Config rule that specifies the tag key 
and value you want to use and the resources you want to apply the tag to. You can then enable the rule and AWS Config will
automatically apply the tag to the specified resources when they are created or when their configurations change.

Option B (using Cost Explorer) primarily focuses on cost analysis and does not provide direct enforcement of proper tagging. 
Option C and D (writing API calls and running them manually or through scheduled Lambda) require more manual effort and
maintenance compared to using AWS Config rules.

32. A development team needs to host a website that will be accessed by other teams. The website contents consist of HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images.
Which method is the MOST cost-effective for hosting the website?

A. Containerize the website and host it in AWS Fargate.
B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there.
C. Deploy a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance to host the website.
D. Configure an Application Load Balancer with an AWS Lambda target that uses the Express.js framework.


ans:
Good answer is B: client-side JavaScript. the website is static, so it must be S3.

I had initially thought Ans A... but its Ans C -- "cookieMr" makes it clear:
Ans A "Containerising the website and hosting with AWS Fargate involves additional complexity and costs associated with managing 
the container environment and scaling resources."
So it has to be...
Ans B: "...Amazon S3 to host the website, take advantage of its durability, scalability, and low-cost pricing model. Only pay
for the storage and data transfer associated with your website, without the need for managing and maintaining web servers or containers.
This reduces the operational overhead and infrastructure costs."

33. A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. 
The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with several other
internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

A. Store the transactions data into Amazon DynamoDB. Set up a rule in DynamoDB to remove sensitive data from every transaction 
upon write. Use DynamoDB Streams to share the transactions data with other applications.
B. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to store data in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3. Use AWS Lambda
integration with Kinesis Data Firehose to remove sensitive data. Other applications can consume the data stored in Amazon S3.
C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every 
transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can 
consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.
D. Store the batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files. Use AWS Lambda to process every file and remove sensitive
data before updating the files in Amazon S3. The Lambda function then stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB.
Other applications can consume transaction files stored in Amazon S3.

ans: I would go for C. The tricky phrase is "near-real-time solution", pointing to Firehouse, 
but it can't send data to DynamoDB, so it leaves us with C as best option.

Kinesis Data Firehose currently supports Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, 
Splunk, Datadog, NewRelic, Dynatrace, Sumologic, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, and HTTP End Point as destinations.

(((((Stream is used if you want real time results , but with firehose , you generally use the data at a later point of time by storing it 
somewhere. Hence if you see "REAL TIME" the answer is most probably Kinesis Data Streams.)))))

A. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and AWS Config to record API calls.
B. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and AWS CloudTrail to record API calls.
C. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls.
D. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls.

instances within a VPC behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). A third-party service is used for the DNS. The company's solutions 
architect must recommend a solution to detect and protect against large-scale DDoS attacks.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Enable Amazon GuardDuty on the account.
B. Enable Amazon Inspector on the EC2 instances.
C. Enable AWS Shield and assign Amazon Route 53 to it.
D. Enable AWS Shield Advanced and assign the ELB to it.

ans: AWS Shield Advanced provides expanded DDoS attack protection for your Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers,
CloudFront distributions, Route 53 hosted zones, and AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerators.
The solution also offers a direct response mechanism (via the AWS DDoS Response Team) for further assistance during attacks.


A: GuardDuty is not for this, mostly for account monitoring for suspicious activity
B: Inspector is for OS vulnerabilities
C: Shield with R53 is not going to protect against DDoS
D: Shield Advanced is build for DDoS protection

36. A company is building an application in the AWS Cloud. The application will store data in Amazon S3 buckets in two AWS Regions. 
The company must use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt all data that is stored in the S3 buckets. 
The data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key. The data and the key must be stored in each of the two Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between
the S3 buckets. Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.
C. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption 
with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
D. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS
KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.

ans:
B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.

Explanation:
The requirement is to use the same KMS key in both AWS Regions.
AWS multi-Region KMS keys allow encryption and decryption across multiple Regions using the same key.
Client-side encryption ensures that the application encrypts the data before storing it in S3, so the same KMS key can be used across both Regions.
Replication is necessary to keep data synchronized between the two S3 buckets.

Why not the other options?
A: Uses Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), but the requirement is to use a customer managed KMS key.
C: Uses a customer managed KMS key but does not support using the same key across Regions.
D: Uses SSE-KMS, but each Region will have a different KMS key because single-Region KMS keys cannot be used across Regions.

37. A company recently launched a variety of new workloads on Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. The company needs to create a 
strategy to access and administer the instances remotely and securely. The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works
with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use the EC2 serial console to directly access the terminal interface of each instance for administration.
B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to
establish a remote SSH session. Most Voted
C. Create an administrative SSH key pair. Load the public key into each EC2 instance. Deploy a bastion host in a public 
subnet to provide a tunnel for administration of each instance.
D. Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Instruct administrators to use their local on-premises machines to connect
directly to the instances by using SSH keys across the VPN tunnel.



ans:
Option A provides direct access to the terminal interface of each instance, but it may not be practical for administration 
purposes and can be cumbersome to manage, especially for multiple instances.

Option C adds operational overhead and introduces additional infrastructure that needs to be managed, monitored,
and secured. It also requires SSH key management and maintenance.

Option D is complex and may not be necessary for remote administration. It also requires administrators to connect from 
their local on-premises machines, which adds complexity and potential security risks.

Therefore, option B is the recommended solution as it provides secure, auditable, and repeatable remote access using IAM roles and AWS Systems
Manager Session Manager, with minimal operational overhead.

38. A company is hosting a static website on Amazon S3 and is using Amazon Route 53 for DNS. The website is experiencing increased 
demand from around the world. The company must decrease latency for users who access the website.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Replicate the S3 bucket that contains the website to all AWS Regions. Add Route 53 geolocation routing entries.
B. Provision accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator. Associate the supplied IP addresses with the S3 bucket. Edit the Route
53 entries to point to the IP addresses of the accelerators.
C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the CloudFront distribution. Most Voted
D. Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration on the bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the new endpoint.


ans: 
Keywords:
Global, Reduce latency, S3, Static Website, Cost effective = Amazon CloudFront

Option A (replicating the S3 bucket to all AWS Regions) can be costly and complex, requiring replication of data 
across multiple Regions and managing synchronization. It may not provide a significant latency 
improvement compared to the CloudFront solution.

Option B (provisioning accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator) can be more expensive as it adds
an extra layer of infrastructure (accelerators) and requires associating IP addresses with the S3 bucket. 
CloudFront already includes global edge locations and provides similar acceleration capabilities.

Option D (enabling S3 Transfer Acceleration) can help improve upload speed to the S3 bucket but may not
have a significant impact on reducing latency for website visitors.

Therefore, option C is the most cost-effective solution as it leverages CloudFront's caching and global
distribution capabilities to decrease latency and improve website performance.

39. A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table
that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against
this data every day through the company's website.
The company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem.
Which solution addresses this performance issue?

A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.
B. Change the DB instance to a memory optimized instance class.
C. Change the DB instance to a burstable performance instance class.
D. Enable Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication.


ans:
A: Made for high levels of I/O opps for consistent, predictable performance.
B: Can improve performance of insert opps, but it's a storage performance rather than processing power problem
C: for moderate CPU usage
D: for scale read-only replicas and doesn't improve performance of insert opps on the primary DB instance

40. A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert
is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis.
The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want 
to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose 
stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration 
to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days. Most Voted
B. Launch Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer to ingest the alerts. 
Create a script on the EC2 instances that will store the alerts in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle 
configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.
C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose 
stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster. Set up the Amazon 
OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to take manual snapshots every day
and delete data from the cluster that is older than 14 days.
D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to ingest the alerts, and set the message 
retention period to 14 days. Configure consumers to poll the SQS queue, check the age of the message, and analyze 
the message data as needed. If the message is 14 days old, the consumer should copy the message to
an Amazon S3 bucket and delete the message from the SQS queue.


ans:
B suggests launching EC2 instances to ingest and store the alerts, which introduces additional infrastructure
management overhead and may not be as cost-effective and scalable as using 
managed services like Kinesis Data Firehose and S3.
C involves delivering the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster and manually managing snapshots and data deletion. This introduces
additional complexity and manual overhead compared to the simpler solution of using Kinesis Data Firehose and S3.
D suggests using SQS to ingest the alerts, but it does not provide the same level of data persistence and durability as storing 
the alerts directly in S3. Additionally, it requires manual processing and 
copying of messages to S3, which adds operational complexity.

Therefore, A provides the most operationally efficient solution that meets the company's requirements by leveraging Kinesis Data 
Firehose to ingest the alerts, storing them in an S3 bucket, and using an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to S3 
Glacier for long-term archival, all without the need for managing additional infrastructure.
Only A makes sense operationally, as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that can capture, transform, and deliver
streaming data into storage systems or analytics tools, making it an ideal solution for ingesting and 
storing status alerts. In this solution, the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ingests the alerts 
and delivers them to an S3 bucket, which is a cost-effective storage solution. An S3 Lifecycle configuration 
is set up to transition the data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days to minimize storage costs.

If you think D, just consider what is needed to move the message from SQS to S3... you are polling daily 14 TB to take out 1 TB...
that's no operationally efficient at all.
"A" is simply correct because kinesis firehouse is made for this, SQS standard is not going to support 500 million alerts 2KB each (1 TB) this service is made for requests that are lighter.

41. A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection. The company runs
Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis. The same EC2 instance that
receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete. The company has noticed slow
application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create an Auto Scaling group so that EC2 instances can scale out. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to
send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for each SaaS source to send output data. Configure the S3 bucket as
the rule's target. Create a second EventBridge (Cloud Watch Events) rule to send events when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the second rule's target.
D. Create a Docker container to use instead of an EC2 instance. Host the containerized application on Amazon Elastic Container Service 
(Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when 
the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

sol: AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that helps you securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) 
applications such as Salesforce, SAP, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and ServiceNow, and AWS services such as Amazon 
Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Redshift in just a "few clicks". remember the question is asking 
for "the LEAST operational overhead", While Auto Scaling improves performance, it still involves managing EC2 instances, 
which adds operational overhead compared to a managed service like AppFlow.

42. A company runs a highly available image-processing application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single VPC. The EC2 instances run inside
several subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances do not communicate with each other. However, the EC2 instances download 
images from Amazon S3 and upload images to Amazon S3 through a single NAT gateway. The company is concerned about data transfer charges.
What is the MOST cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges?

A. Launch the NAT gateway in each Availability Zone.
B. Replace the NAT gateway with a NAT instance.
C. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3.
D. Provision an EC2 Dedicated Host to run the EC2 instances.

ans: C
Deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 is the most cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer 
charges. A gateway VPC endpoint is a network gateway that allows communication between instances in a VPC and
a service, such as Amazon S3, without requiring an Internet gateway or a NAT device. Data transfer between the VPC 
and the service through a gateway VPC endpoint is free of charge, while data transfer between the VPC and the Internet 
through an Internet gateway or NAT device is subject to data transfer charges. By using a gateway VPC endpoint, the 
company can reduce its data transfer costs by eliminating the need to transfer data through the NAT gateway to access Amazon S3.
This option would provide the required connectivity to Amazon S3 and minimize data transfer charges.

43. A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3.
The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations. A solutions architect needs to design 
a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Establish AWS VPN connections and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint.
B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.
C. Order daily AWS Snowball devices. Load the data onto the Snowball devices and return the devices to AWS each day.
D. Submit a support ticket through the AWS Management Console. Request the removal of S3 service limits from the account.
 
ans:
AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your
on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication 
between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, 
you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.

A: VPN also goes through the internet and uses the bandwidth
C: daily Snowball transfer is not really a long-term solution when it comes to cost and efficiency
D: S3 limits don't change anything here

44. A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.
C. Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
D. Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket.
E. Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket.

ans: A B

Enabling versioning on S3 ensures multiple versions of object are stored in bucket. When object is updated
or deleted, new version is created, preserving previous version.

Enabling MFA Delete adds additional layer of protection by requiring MFA device to be present when attempting 
to delete objects. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions by requiring extra level of authentication.

C. Creating a bucket policy on S3 is more focused on defining access control and permissions for bucket 
and its objects, rather than protecting against accidental deletion.

D. Enabling default encryption on S3 ensures that any new objects uploaded to bucket are automatically 
encrypted. While encryption is important for data security, it does not directly address accidental deletion.

E. Creating lifecycle policy for objects in S3 allows for automated management of objects based on predefined
rules. While this can help with data retention and storage cost optimization, it does not directly protect against accidental deletion.

45. A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:
• An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries
• An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata
The company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure 
occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)

A. Deploy the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones.
B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
C. Increase the CPU and memory that are allocated to the Lambda function.
D. Increase provisioned throughput for the Lambda function.
E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

ans: b and e 
B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic:
By adding an SQS queue between the SNS topic and the Lambda function, you decouple the notification and processing layers.
Messages are stored reliably in the SQS queue, and they are not lost even if the Lambda function fails 
temporarily due to network connectivity or other issues.

E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue:
Configuring the Lambda function to poll the SQS queue ensures that messages are processed asynchronously. If a processing 
failure occurs, the message remains in the queue and can be retried without manual intervention.
This ensures all data is eventually processed.

46. A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by
store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to 
generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size.
Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII)
that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

A. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects 
contain PII, trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the objects that contain PII.
B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain 
PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.
C. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket.
If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators 
to remove the objects that contain PII.
D. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket.
If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to trigger a notification to the administrators and trigger
an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the meats that contain PII.

ans: Amazon Macie is a data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning (ML) and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data

The Key words are PII, 200 GB, and automate remediation
A) Amazon Inspector is about software & network vulnerability detection
B) Amazon Macie is for PII detection, but it has severe quota limitations, i.e. it will only retrieve and analyze a 25MB
JSON file or 100MB text file (wonder if people save JSON as text to analyze bigger files)
Also it's not automatically remediating the problem files
C) won't automatically remediate the problem files
D) While more development effort required than using Macie, it will actually (once developed)
analyze and automatically remove the bad file

This is a horrible question, and the real answer would be to break down the data into smaller chunks and use Macie on that

47. A company needs guaranteed Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last 1 week.
What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity?

A. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed.
B. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed.
C. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

ans: 
Reserved instances require a fixed one-year or three-year commitment. 

Option D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
An On-Demand Capacity Reservation is a type of Amazon EC2 reservation that enables you to create and manage reserved
capacity on Amazon EC2. With an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, you can specify the Region and Availability Zones
where you want to reserve capacity, and the number of EC2 instances you want to reserve. This allows you 
to guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones in a specific Region.

***WRONG***
Option A, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed, would not guarantee 
capacity in specific Availability Zones.
Option B, creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed, would 
not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones.
Option C, why Reserved Instances aren't the solution here is that you have to commit to either a 1 year or 3 year term, not 1 week.

49. A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, 
but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability
to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Query the tags to retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. 
Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query 
and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.
C. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Store search metadata for each archive in 
Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year.
Query and retrieve the files by searching for metadata from Amazon S3.
D. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier 
Deep Archive after 1 year. Store search metadata in Amazon RDS. Query the files from Amazon RDS. Retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.


ans:
B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of
object size or retention period. You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for virtually any workload, 
especially data lakes, data analytics, new applications, and user-generated content.

50. A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software.
The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
B. Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
C. Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.

ans:

This question is about patching a critical security vulnerability in third-party software on 1,000 EC2 Linux instances as quickly as possible

Patch Manager is optimized for OS-level security patches and may not support the specific third-party software patch required in this scenario.
Even if the third-party software is supported, Patch Manager may not provide the level of control or speed needed for a critical security update.
so, Run Command allows you to automate common administrative tasks and perform one-time configuration changes at scale. (

51. A company is developing an application that provides order shipping statistics for retrieval by a REST API. 
The company wants to extract the shipping statistics, organize the data into an easy-to-read HTML format, and send the
report to several email addresses at the same time every morning.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Configure the application to send the data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
B. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Glue job to query the application's API for the data.
D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.
E. Store the application data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as an S3 event destination to send the report by email.

ans: B D
D Explanation: EventBridge can be used to schedule regular invocations of a Lambda function that retrieves
the required data from the application's API. This step sets up the process to collect 
the data at the specified time every morning.
B Explanation: Amazon SES can format the data into an easy-to-read HTML report and
send the email to multiple recipients efficiently.

A. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose: This service is typically used for real-time streaming data processing
rather than for scheduled tasks like generating a morning report.
C. Amazon EventBridge to invoke an AWS Glue job: AWS Glue is a data integration service that's more focused on ETL 
(extract, transform, load) operations, often involving large datasets and complex transformations, which might be more than needed for this scenario.
E. Amazon S3 with SNS topic: Storing data in S3 and using SNS for notification is viable, but this doesn't directly
address the need to format the data into HTML and send it as an email report. SNS is better suited for sending notifications rather than formatted reports.

52. A company wants to migrate its on-premises application to AWS. The application produces output files that vary in size from tens
of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. The application data must be stored in a standard file system structure. The company wants a solution that 
scales automatically. is highly available, and requires minimum operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Use Amazon S3 for storage.
B. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.
C. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storage.
D. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.

ans: C
EFS as It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.
Multiple compute instances, including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda,
can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, providing a common data source
for workloads.

archived for an additional 9 years. No one at the company, including administrative users and root users, can be able to delete the records 
during the entire 10-year period. The records must be stored with maximum resiliency.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Store the records in S3 Glacier for the entire 10-year period. Use an access control policy to deny deletion
of the records for a period of 10 years.
B. Store the records by using S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use an IAM policy to deny deletion of the records. After 10 years,
change the IAM policy to allow deletion.
C. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Use S3 Object 
Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years.
D. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 year.
Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode for a period of 10 years.

ans: C

Only CD provides Object Lock options which is required for stopping admin/root users from deleting.
D is governance mode which is like government, pay enough money and you can do anything. This is not what we want so compliance is the option.
C is right choice.

54. A company runs multiple Windows workloads on AWS. The company's employees use Windows file shares that are hosted
on two Amazon EC2 instances. The file shares synchronize data between themselves and maintain duplicate copies. 
The company wants a highly available and durable storage solution that preserves how users currently access the files.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Migrate all the data to Amazon S3. Set up IAM authentication for users to access files.
B. Set up an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Mount the S3 File Gateway on the existing EC2 instances.
C. Extend the file share environment to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate 
all the data to FSx for Windows File Server.
D. Extend the file share environment to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate
all the data to Amazon EFS.

ans: c

Migrating all the data to FSx for Windows File Server allows you to preserve existing user access method and maintain
compatibility with Windows file shares. Users can continue accessing files using the same method as before, without any disruptions.

A: S3 is a highly durable object storage service, it is not designed to directly host Windows file shares. Implementing
IAM authentication for file access would require significant changes to existing user access method.

B: S3 File Gateway can provide access to Amazon S3 objects through standard file protocols, it may not be ideal
solution for preserving existing user access method and maintaining Windows file shares.

D: Although Amazon EFS provides highly available and durable file storage, it may not directly support
the existing Windows file shares and their access method.

55. A solutions architect is developing a VPC architecture that includes multiple subnets. The architecture will host
applications that use Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances. The architecture consists of six subnets in 
two Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone includes a public subnet, a private subnet, and a dedicated subnet for databases.
Only EC2 instances that run in the private subnets can have access to the RDS databases.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create a new route table that excludes the route to the public subnets' CIDR blocks. Associate the 
route table with the database subnets.
B. Create a security group that denies inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances
in the public subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.
C. Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in
the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.
D. Create a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets. Create a different peering 
connection between the private subnets and the database subnets.

name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import 
the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region.
Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure
Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.
D. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the 
public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. 
Attach the certificate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name.
Point an A record to the company's domain name.


ans:

Option C includes all the necessary steps to meet the requirements, hence it is the correct solution.

Options A and D do not include the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway 
endpoint with the company's domain name and attach the certificate to the endpoint.

Option B includes the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name
and attach the certificate, but it imports the certificate into the us-east-1 Region
instead of the ca-central-1 Region where the API Gateway is located.

To design the API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate, the company needs to do the following:
1. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to create an endpoint that is specific to a region.
2. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name: This will allow the company to use
its own domain name for the API Gateway URL.
3. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the 
same Region: This will allow the company to use HTTPS for secure communication with its APIs.
4. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use the certificate
for securing the API Gateway URL.
5. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use Route 53 to route traffic
to the API Gateway URL using the company's domain name.

57. A company is running a popular social media website. The website gives users the ability to upload images to share with
other users. The company wants to make sure that the images do not contain inappropriate content. 
The company needs a solution that minimizes development effort.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon Comprehend to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
B. Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
C. Use Amazon SageMaker to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.
D. Use AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.

ans: B
The best solution to meet these requirements would be option B: Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content, 
and use human review for low-confidence predictions.

Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based image and video analysis service that can detect inappropriate content in images 
using its pre-trained label detection model. It can identify a wide range of inappropriate content,
including explicit or suggestive adult content, violent content, and offensive language. The
service provides high accuracy and low latency, making it a good choice for this use case.

Option A, using Amazon Comprehend, is not a good fit for this use case because Amazon Comprehend is 
a natural language processing service that is designed to analyze text, not images.

Option C, using Amazon SageMaker to detect inappropriate content, would require significant development 
effort to build and train a custom machine learning model. It would also require a large dataset of labeled 
images to train the model, which may be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.

Option D, using AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model, would also require significant development
effort and a large dataset of labeled images. It may not be the most efficient or cost-effective solution for this use case.

In summary, the best solution is to use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content in images, and use human
review for low-confidence predictions to ensure that all inappropriate content is detected.

58. A company wants to run its critical applications in containers to meet requirements for scalability and availability. 
The company prefers to focus on maintenance of the critical applications. The company does not want to be responsible 
for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure that runs the containerized workload.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon EC2 instances, and install Docker on the instances.
B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on Amazon EC2 worker nodes.
C. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate.
D. Use Amazon EC2 instances from an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

ans: C
Using ECS on Fargate allows you to run containers without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Fargate 
abstracts away the underlying EC2 and provides serverless compute for containers.

A. This option would require manual provisioning and management of EC2, as well as installing and configuring Docker 
on those instances. It would introduce additional overhead and responsibilities for maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

B. While this option leverages ECS to manage containers, it still requires provisioning and managing EC2 to serve 
as worker nodes. It adds complexity and maintenance overhead compared to the serverless nature of Fargate.

D. This option still involves managing and provisioning EC2, even though an ECS-optimized AMI simplifies the process
of setting up EC2 for running ECS. It does not provide the level of serverless abstraction and ease of management offered by Fargate.

59. A company hosts more than 300 global websites and applications. The company requires a platform to analyze more than 30 TB of clickstream data each day.
What should a solutions architect do to transmit and process the clickstream data?

A. Design an AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and run an Amazon EMR
cluster with the data to generate analytics.
B. Create an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and send it to an Amazon
S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis.
C. Cache the data to Amazon CloudFront. Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. When an object is added
to the S3 bucket. run an AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis.
D. Collect the data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the
data to an Amazon S3 data lake. Load the data in Amazon Redshift for analysis.

ans:
Option D is the most appropriate solution for transmitting and processing the clickstream data in this scenario.
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a highly scalable and durable service that enables real-time processing of streaming 
data at a high volume and high rate. You can use Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process the clickstream data in real-time.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that loads streaming data into data stores and analytics tools
You can use Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data from Kinesis Data Streams to an Amazon S3 data lake.

Once the data is in the data lake, you can use Amazon Redshift to load the data and perform analysis on it. Amazon 
Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that allows you to quickly and efficiently analyze 
data using SQL and your existing business intelligence tools.

**Kinesis Data Streams can continuously capture and ingest high volumes of clickstream data in real-time. This handles the large 30TB daily data intake.
Kinesis Firehose can automatically load the streaming data into S3. This creates a data lake for further analysis.
Firehose can transform and analyze the data in flight before loading to S3 using Lambda. This enables real-time processing.
The data in S3 can be easily loaded into Amazon Redshift for interactive analysis at scale.
Kinesis auto scales to handle the high data volumes. Minimal effort is needed for infrastructure management.**

Option A, which involves using AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and running an Amazon
EMR cluster with the data to generate analytics, is not the most appropriate solution 
because it does not involve real-time processing of the data.

Option B, which involves creating an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and 
sending it to an Amazon S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis, is not the most appropriate solution because 
it does not involve a fully managed service for transmitting the data from the processing layer to the data lake.

Option C, which involves caching the data to Amazon CloudFront, storing the data in an Amazon S3 bucket, and running an
AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis when an object is added to the S3 bucket, is not the most appropriate
solution because it does not involve a scalable and durable service for collecting and processing the data in real-time.

60. A company has a website hosted on AWS. The website is behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that is configured to handle HTTP and HTTPS separately.
The company wants to forward all requests to the website so that the requests will use HTTPS.
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

A. Update the ALB's network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic.
B. Create a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS.
C. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
D. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication (SNI).

ans: c

A. Network ACLs operate at subnet level and control inbound and outbound traffic. Updating the
network ACL alone will not enforce the redirection of HTTP to HTTPS.
B. This approach would require modifying application code or server configuration to perform URL rewrite. It is
not an optimal solution as it adds complexity and potential maintenance overhead. Moreover, it does not leverage the ALB's 
capabilities for handling HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.
D. While NLB can handle SSL/TLS termination using SNI for routing requests to different services, replacing th ALB solely to
enforce HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection would be an unnecessary and more complex solution.

Therefore, the recommended approach is to create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. By configuring a listener rule, 
you can define a redirect action that automatically directs HTTP requests to their corresponding HTTPS versions.

61. A company has multiple Windows file servers on premises. The company wants to migrate and consolidate its files into an Amazon FSx for
Windows File Server file system. File permissions must be preserved to ensure that access rights do not change.

Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Deploy AWS DataSync agents on premises. Schedule DataSync tasks to transfer the data to the FSx for Windows File Server file system. Most Voted
B. Copy the shares on each file server into Amazon S3 buckets by using the AWS CLI. Schedule AWS DataSync tasks to transfer the data to the 
FSx for Windows File Server file system.
C. Remove the drives from each file server. Ship the drives to AWS for import into Amazon S3. Schedule AWS DataSync tasks to transfer the data 
to the FSx for Windows File Server file system.
D. Order an AWS Snowcone device. Connect the device to the on-premises network. Launch AWS DataSync agents on the device. Schedule DataSync tasks
to transfer the data to the FSx for Windows File Server file system. Most Voted
E. Order an AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device. Connect the device to the on-premises network. Copy data to the device by using the AWS CLI. 
Ship the device back to AWS for import into Amazon S3. Schedule AWS DataSync tasks to transfer the data to the FSx for Windows File Server file system.



sol: A and D


B, C and E would copy the files to S3 first where permissions would be lost







------------------
62. A company has multiple VPCs across AWS Regions to support and run workloads that are isolated from workloads in other Regions. Because of a recent application 
launch requirement, the company’s VPCs must communicate with all other VPCs across all Regions.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of administrative effort?

A. Use VPC peering to manage VPC communication in a single Region. Use VPC peering across Regions to manage VPC communications.
B. Use AWS Direct Connect gateways across all Regions to connect VPCs across regions and manage VPC communications.
C. Use AWS Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region and Transit Gateway peering across Regions to manage VPC communications. Most Voted
D. Use AWS PrivateLink across all Regions to connect VPCs across Regions and manage VPC communications


ans: C (multiple regions + multiple VPCs --> Transit Gateway)
 Use AWS Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region and Transit Gateway peering across Regions to manage VPC communications.
AWS Transit Gateway is a network hub that you can use to connect your VPCs and on-premises networks. It provides a single point of 
control for managing your network traffic, and it can help you to reduce the number of connections that you need to manage.

Transit Gateway peering allows you to connect two Transit Gateways in different Regions. This can help you to 
create a global network that spans multiple Regions.

To use Transit Gateway to manage VPC communication in a single Region, you would create a Transit Gateway in each Region.
You would then attach your VPCs to the Transit Gateway.

To use Transit Gateway peering to manage VPC communication across Regions, you would create a Transit Gateway
peering connection between the Transit Gateways in each Region.




(((((
Option A: VPC Peering (Single Region + Cross-Region)
What it means: VPC Peering is a direct, point-to-point network connection between two VPCs.
How it works:
Inside a single AWS Region, you establish multiple VPC peering connections.
For cross-region communication, you set up VPC peering between VPCs in different Regions.
Challenges:
It requires manual setup and management of multiple peering connections.
As the number of VPCs increases, the complexity grows exponentially due to the need for a full mesh network (i.e., every VPC needs a connection to every other VPC).
No centralized routing or management.
👉 Not the best option because it requires a lot of administrative effort.

Option B: AWS Direct Connect Gateways Across Regions
What it means: AWS Direct Connect (DX) is a dedicated private connection from an on-premises data center to AWS. A Direct Connect Gateway enables
multiple VPCs in different AWS Regions to connect via a single Direct Connect link.
How it works:
Typically used for hybrid cloud scenarios where an on-premises data center is connected to AWS.
Allows VPCs to communicate via an external on-premises network using Direct Connect.
Challenges:
Not designed for VPC-to-VPC communication. It primarily facilitates connectivity between on-premises networks and AWS, not for direct VPC interconnectivity.
Requires additional physical infrastructure (Direct Connect links), which increases cost and complexity.
👉 Not the right choice because Direct Connect is not optimized for VPC-to-VPC communication.

Option C: AWS Transit Gateway with Peering Across Regions (Best Option)
What it means: AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) is a scalable, centralized hub that simplifies VPC-to-VPC communication.
How it works:
Inside a single Region, Transit Gateway allows multiple VPCs to connect via a single hub rather than requiring multiple VPC peering connections.
For cross-region communication, Transit Gateway supports peering between Transit Gateways in different AWS Regions.
It provides a centralized routing mechanism, reducing the complexity of managing multiple peer connections.
Advantages:
Scalability – Can handle thousands of VPCs without requiring individual peering connections.
Simplifies management – No need to configure numerous VPC peering connections manually.
Better performance and security – Uses AWS backbone instead of public internet.
👉 This is the best solution because it minimizes administrative effort and scales efficiently. ✅

Option D: AWS PrivateLink Across Regions
What it means: AWS PrivateLink enables secure access to AWS services and internal applications without exposing traffic to the public internet.
How it works:
PrivateLink does not connect VPCs directly; instead, it allows specific services (like internal applications or AWS services) to be accessed privately from another VPC.
It is typically used when one VPC provides a service that needs to be consumed by another VPC.
Challenges:
Not designed for full VPC-to-VPC communication. It is service-specific, meaning you can only expose certain applications but not enable general networking between VPCs.
Does not support routing between entire VPC networks.
👉 Not suitable for full VPC interconnectivity across Regions.

---------------------


A company has an AWS Direct Connect connection from its on-premises location to an AWS account. The AWS account has 30 different VPCs 
in the same AWS Region. The VPCs use private virtual interfaces (VIFs). Each VPC has a CIDR block that does
not overlap with other networks under the company's control.

The company wants to centrally manage the networking architecture while still allowing each VPC to communicate with all other VPCs and on-premises networks.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Create a transit gateway, and associate the Direct Connect connection with a new transit VIF. Turn on the transit 
gateway's route propagation feature. Most Voted
B. Create a Direct Connect gateway. Recreate the private VIFs to use the new gateway. Associate each VPC by 
creating new virtual private gateways.
C. Create a transit VPConnect the Direct Connect connection to the transit VPCreate a peering connection between all 
other VPCs in the Region. Update the route tables.
D. Create AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections from on premises to each VPC. Ensure that both VPN tunnels are UP for
each connection. Turn on the route propagation feature.

ans:

A. Create a transit gateway, and associate the Direct Connect connection with a new transit VIF. Turn on 
the transit gateway's route propagation feature.
Transit Gateway is a central hub for VPC networking, enabling inter-VPC communication without complex peering or managing routes manually.
Direct Connect with Transit VIF: You would associate the Direct Connect connection with a new transit virtual interface (VIF) to
allow the on-premises network to communicate with the transit gateway.
Route Propagation: By enabling route propagation on the transit gateway, routes between all VPCs and the on-premises 
network are automatically updated in each VPC's route table.

Why is this the best option?

The Transit Gateway simplifies the routing architecture by allowing centralized communication between all VPCs and the on-premises network.
Minimal operational overhead: Once the transit gateway is set up, all VPCs are automatically connected to each other and the on-premises network, 
and routes are automatically propagated.
It scales well as new VPCs are added, since you don't need to modify individual VPC route tables or manage a complex network of peering connections.


B. Create a Direct Connect gateway. Recreate the private VIFs to use the new gateway. Associate each VPC by creating new virtual private gateways.
Direct Connect Gateway allows you to connect multiple VPCs (in the same or different regions) to a Direct Connect connection.
However, for each VPC, you'd need to create a new virtual private gateway and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway. This means you'll have to set up multiple private virtual interfaces and ensure each VPC has its own VPN connection.

Why this isn't the best option:
It requires more manual setup for each VPC (creating VPGs and updating routing) compared to a Transit Gateway.
Higher operational overhead: You need to manage connections for each VPC separately, which increases complexity as the number of VPCs grows.
Scaling is harder: Adding new VPCs requires creating new virtual private gateways and modifying the route tables.


C. Create a transit VPC. Connect the Direct Connect connection to the transit VPC. Create a peering connection between all other 
VPCs in the region. Update the route tables.
A transit VPC is a solution where you create a VPC that acts as a hub for routing traffic to other VPCs. You would then create
VPC peering between the transit VPC and the other VPCs.
You'd also need to manually manage route tables to ensure communication between VPCs and the on-premises network.

Why this isn't the best option:
Manual peering between every VPC adds significant complexity. As the number of VPCs grows, the number of
peering connections increases, which becomes hard to maintain.
This approach is less scalable and requires more manual route table management.
Higher operational overhead, especially as more VPCs and resources are added.

D. Create AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections from on-premises to each VPC. Ensure that both VPN tunnels are
UP for each connection. Turn on the route propagation feature.
This option involves creating individual Site-to-Site VPN connections from your on-premises network to each VPC.
Each VPC would need a dedicated VPN connection, and you'd enable route propagation to automatically update routes.

Why this isn’t ideal:
VPN connections are useful but come with higher operational overhead: Managing 30 Site-to-Site VPNs would be complex and time-consuming.
Scalability becomes difficult as the number of VPCs grows.
This option would increase costs and add complexity to your network architecture compared to other options.

63. A company is building an ecommerce application and needs to store sensitive customer information. The company needs to give customers the ability to complete
purchase transactions on the website. The company also needs to ensure that sensitive customer data is protected, even from database administrators.

Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Store sensitive data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Use EBS encryption to encrypt the data. Use an IAM instance role to restrict access.
B. Store sensitive data in Amazon RDS for MySQL. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) client-side encryption to encrypt the data. Most Voted
C. Store sensitive data in Amazon S3. Use AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) server-side encryption to encrypt the data. Use S3 bucket policies to restrict access.
D. Store sensitive data in Amazon FSx for Windows Server. Mount the file share on application servers. Use Windows file permissions to restrict access.


sol: 
RDS MySQL provides a fully managed database service well suited for an ecommerce application.
AWS KMS client-side encryption allows encrypting sensitive data before it hits the database. The data remains encrypted at rest.
This protects sensitive customer data from database admins and privileged users.
EBS encryption (Option A) protects data at rest but not in use. IAM roles don't prevent admin access.
>>>S3 (Option C) encrypts data at rest on the server side. Bucket policies don't restrict admin access.
FSx file permissions (Option D) don't prevent admin access to unencrypted data.



----------
64. A company wants to securely exchange data between its software as a service (SaaS) application Salesforce account and Amazon S3. The company must encrypt 
the data at rest by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed keys (CMKs). The company must also encrypt the data in transit. 
The company has enabled API access for the Salesforce account.

A. Create AWS Lambda functions to transfer the data securely from Salesforce to Amazon S3.
B. Create an AWS Step Functions workflow. Define the task to transfer the data securely from Salesforce to Amazon S3.
C. Create Amazon AppFlow flows to transfer the data securely from Salesforce to Amazon S3. Most Voted
D. Create a custom connector for Salesforce to transfer the data securely from Salesforce to Amazon S3.

ans: Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that allows you to securely transfer data between different SaaS applications and AWS services.
It provides built-in encryption options and supports encryption in transit using SSL/TLS protocols. With AppFlow, you can configure the data transfer flow 
from Salesforce to Amazon S3, ensuring data encryption at rest by utilizing AWS KMS CMKs.

65. A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group behind an Application Load Balancer that has sticky sessions enabled.
The web server currently hosts the user session state. The company wants to ensure high availability and avoid user session state loss in the event of a web server outage.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached instance to store the session data. Update the application to use ElastiCache for Memcached to store the session state.
B. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Redis to store the session state. Update the application to use ElastiCache for Redis to store the session state. Most Voted
C. Use an AWS Storage Gateway cached volume to store session data. Update the application to use AWS Storage Gateway cached volume to store the session state.
D. Use Amazon RDS to store the session state. Update the application to use Amazon RDS to store the session state.


sol: 
The key points are:

ElastiCache Redis provides in-memory caching that can deliver microsecond latency for session data.
Redis supports replication and multi-AZ which can provide high availability for the cache.
The application can be updated to store session data in ElastiCache Redis rather than locally on the web servers.
If a web server fails, the user can be routed via the load balancer to another web server which can retrieve their session data 
from the highly available ElastiCache Redis cluster.

A company that uses AWS is building an application to transfer data to a product manufacturer. The company has its own identity provider (IdP). The company 
wants the IdP to authenticate application users while the users use the application to transfer data. The company must use Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) protocol.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS DataSync to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication.
B. Use Amazon AppFlow flows to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) task for IdP authentication.
C. Use AWS Transfer Family to transfer the data. Create an AWS Lambda function for IdP authentication. Most Voted
D. Use AWS Storage Gateway to transfer the data. Create an Amazon Cognito identity pool for IdP authentication.



Option C stands out stronger because AWS Transfer Family securely scales your recurring business-to-business file transfers to AWS Storage
services using SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and AS2 protocols.
And AWS Lambda can be used to authenticate users with the company's IdP.

Applicability Statement 2 (AS2) is a business-to-business (B2B) messaging protocol used to exchange Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) documents. 
With AWS Transfer Family’s AS2 capabilities, you can securely exchange AS2 messages at scale while maintaining compliance and interoperability with your trading partners.

A company runs applications on Amazon EC2 instances in one AWS Region. The company wants to back up the EC2 instances to a second Region. The company
also wants to provision EC2 resources in the second Region and manage the EC2 instances centrally from one AWS account.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Create a disaster recovery (DR) plan that has a similar number of EC2 instances in the second Region. Configure data replication.
B. Create point-in-time Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) snapshots of the EC2 instances. Copy the snapshots to the second Region periodically.
C. Create a backup plan by using AWS Backup. Configure cross-Region backup to the second Region for the EC2 instances. Most Voted
D. Deploy a similar number of EC2 instances in the second Region. Use AWS DataSync to transfer the data from the source Region to the second Region.


ans:

C is the most cost-effective solution that meets all the requirements.
AWS Backup provides automated backups across Regions for EC2 instances. This handles the backup requirement.
AWS Backup is more cost-effective for cross-Region EC2 backups than using EBS snapshots manually or DataSync.

Well Datasync is to transfer data from on-prem to AWS rather than AWS R1 to R2, and it is use for a one-time migration rather
than repetitive data migration activities like backups hence its out(on so many levels)




----------------------------
A company runs several websites on AWS for its different brands. Each website generates tens of gigabytes of web traffic logs each day. A solutions 
architect needs to design a scalable solution to give the company's developers the ability to analyze traffic patterns across all the company's websites. 
This analysis by the developers will occur on demand once a week over the course of several months. The solution must support queries with standard SQL.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Store the logs in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena tor analysis. Most Voted
B. Store the logs in Amazon RDS. Use a database client for analysis.
C. Store the logs in Amazon OpenSearch Service. Use OpenSearch Service for analysis.
D. Store the logs in an Amazon EMR cluster Use a supported open-source framework for SQL-based analysis.

sol:
Scalable + "The solution must support queries with standard SQL" = A
B not scalable
C OpenSearch is like ElasticSearch so does not support SQL syntax
D EMR is processing not storage. Map-Reduce can use SQL like syntax but this option does not solve scalable storage issues.
You normally run EMR on some stored data



--------------------------
A company wants to monitor its AWS costs for financial review. The cloud operations team is designing an architecture in the AWS Organizations management 
account to query AWS Cost and Usage Reports for all member accounts. The team must run this query once a month and provide a detailed analysis of the bill.

Which solution is the MOST scalable and cost-effective way to meet these requirements?

A. Enable Cost and Usage Reports in the management account. Deliver reports to Amazon Kinesis. Use Amazon EMR for analysis.
B. Enable Cost and Usage Reports in the management account. Deliver the reports to Amazon S3 Use Amazon Athena for analysis.
C. Enable Cost and Usage Reports for member accounts. Deliver the reports to Amazon S3 Use Amazon Redshift for analysis.
D. Enable Cost and Usage Reports for member accounts. Deliver the reports to Amazon Kinesis. Use Amazon QuickSight tor analysis.



A - EMR is powerful for large-scale data processing, but is overkill for a monthly query since neither Kinesis nor EMR is 
cost-effective for infrequent processing.
B - Cost and Usage Reports are already optimized for S3 delivery, and Athena directly integrates with S3.
C & D - Delivering reports for each member account creates redundant data. That mean extra time, extra work to do manually, 
extra money to cost, and extra account to manage.

An international company has a subdomain for each country that the company operates in. The subdomains are formatted as example.com, country1.example.com, 
and country2.example.com. The company's workloads are behind an Application Load Balancer. The company wants to encrypt the website data that is in transit.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a public certificate for the apex top domain example com and
a wildcard certificate for *.example.com. Most Voted
B. Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a private certificate for the apex top domain example.com and a wildcard certificate for *.example.com.
C. Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a public and private certificate for the apex top domain example.com.
D. Validate domain ownership by email address. Switch to DNS validation by adding the required DNS records to the DNS provider.
E. Validate domain ownership for the domain by adding the required DNS records to the DNS provider. Most Voted



ans:

Explanation:
Why is Option A correct?
The company operates a website with multiple subdomains (e.g., country1.example.com, country2.example.com).
To secure all subdomains, a wildcard SSL certificate (*.example.com) is required, which covers all subdomains.
A public certificate is needed because this is a website accessible on the internet.
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) allows requesting a public SSL/TLS certificate for example.com and *.example.com.
This certificate is then used with the Application Load Balancer (ALB) to encrypt traffic.

Why is Option E correct?
Domain validation is required before AWS issues an SSL/TLS certificate.
DNS validation is the recommended method because it is automated and more reliable.
DNS validation involves adding specific CNAME records to the domain’s DNS provider.
Once the DNS records are added and detected by AWS, the certificate is issued.

Why are the other options incorrect?

❌ B. Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a private certificate for the apex top domain example.com and 
a wildcard certificate for *.example.com.
Private certificates are used for internal applications within a private network (e.g., internal company services, not public websites).
Since the company’s website is public, a public certificate is needed instead.

❌ C. Use the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) console to request a public and private certificate for the apex top domain example.com.
A private certificate is unnecessary for public websites.
A public certificate alone is sufficient for securing external websites.
Requesting both public and private certificates does not provide additional benefits for this use case.

❌ D. Validate domain ownership by email address. Switch to DNS validation by adding the required DNS records to the DNS provider.
While email validation is possible, it is less recommended because it requires manual intervention (responding to an email sent to 
the domain’s registered admin).
The company should directly use DNS validation (Option E) instead of switching from email to DNS later.



--------------------------------------

A company uses Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP in its primary AWS Region for CIFS and NFS file shares. Applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances access the file
shares. The company needs a storage disaster recovery (DR) solution in a secondary Region. The data that is replicated in the secondary Region needs 
to be accessed by using the same protocols as the primary Region.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create an AWS Lambda function to copy the data to an Amazon S3 bucket. Replicate the S3 bucket to the secondary Region.
B. Create a backup of the FSx for ONTAP volumes by using AWS Backup. Copy the volumes to the secondary Region. Create a new FSx for ONTAP instance from the backup.
C. Create an FSx for ONTAP instance in the secondary Region. Use NetApp SnapMirror to replicate data from the primary Region to the secondary Region.
D. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) volume. Migrate the current data to the volume. Replicate the volume to the secondary Region.


What is NetApp ONTAP?
NetApp ONTAP is a high-performance, enterprise-grade storage management software designed to manage, store, and protect data across on-premises, 
cloud, and hybrid environments. It provides advanced data management, replication, and security features while supporting multiple
storage protocols like NFS, SMB (CIFS), and iSCSI.

What is Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP?
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP is a fully managed AWS service that brings the NetApp ONTAP storage system to AWS. It allows customers to 
run ONTAP-based storage in the cloud while integrating seamlessly with AWS compute and networking services.

A company has a large data workload that runs for 6 hours each day. The company cannot lose any data while the process is running. A solutions architect 
is designing an Amazon EMR cluster configuration to support this critical data workload.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Configure a long-running cluster that runs the primary node and core nodes on On-Demand Instances and the task nodes on Spot Instances.
B. Configure a transient cluster that runs the primary node and core nodes on On-Demand Instances and the task nodes on Spot Instances. Most Voted
C. Configure a transient cluster that runs the primary node on an On-Demand Instance and the core nodes and task nodes on Spot Instances.
D. Configure a long-running cluster that runs the primary node on an On-Demand Instance, the core nodes on Spot Instances, and the task nodes on Spot Instances.


"Long-running cluster" = runs until you shut it down
"Transient cluster" = runs until the workload is completed
This runs only 6 hours each day -> transient -> B or C


--------------------------

A company maintains an Amazon RDS database that maps users to cost centers. The company has accounts in an organization in AWS Organizations. The company needs 
a solution that will tag all resources that are created in a specific AWS account in the organization. The solution must tag each resource with the cost center ID 
of the user who created the resource.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Move the specific AWS account to a new organizational unit (OU) in Organizations from the management account. Create a service control policy (SCP)
that requires all existing resources to have the correct cost center tag before the resources are created. Apply the SCP to the new OU.
B. Create an AWS Lambda function to tag the resources after the Lambda function looks up the appropriate cost center from the RDS database. Configure
an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to AWS CloudTrail events to invoke the Lambda function. Most Voted
C. Create an AWS CloudFormation stack to deploy an AWS Lambda function. Configure the Lambda function to look up the appropriate cost center from the
RDS database and to tag resources. Create an Amazon EventBridge scheduled rule to invoke the CloudFormation stack.
D. Create an AWS Lambda function to tag the resources with a default value. Configure an Amazon EventBridge rule that reacts to AWS CloudTrail events 
to invoke the Lambda function when a resource is missing the cost center tag.


SCPs cannot directly apply tags to resources; they can only restrict actions based on policies. They do not automatically tag resources. SCPs are
also used to enforce policies across accounts but cannot look up values from an RDS database or dynamically assign tags.

A policy cannot look up "the cost center ID of the user who created the resource", we need Lambda to do that. Thus A is out.
C would work but runs on a schedule which doesn't make sense (and we would temporarily have untagged resources).
D tags resources "with a default value" which is not what we want.

A company uses an on-premises network-attached storage (NAS) system to provide file shares to its high performance computing (HPC) workloads. The company
wants to migrate its latency-sensitive HPC workloads and its storage to the AWS Cloud. The company must be able to provide NFS and SMB multi-protocol access from the file system.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST latency? (Choose two.)

A. Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a cluster placement group. Most Voted
B. Deploy compute optimized EC2 instances into a partition placement group.
C. Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system.
D. Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system.
E. Attach the EC2 instances to an Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. Most Voted


LEAST latency = cluster placement group

Amazon FSx for Lustre = SMB
Amazon FSx for OpenZFS = NFS
Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP = NFS, SMB, iSCSI

A company has customers located across the world. The company wants to use automation to secure its systems and network infrastructure. The company's 
security team must be able to track and audit all incremental changes to the infrastructure.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS Organizations to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Config to track changes.
B. Use AWS CloudFormation to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Config to track changes. Most Voted
C. Use AWS Organizations to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Service Catalog to track changes.
D. Use AWS CloudFormation to set up the infrastructure. Use AWS Service Catalog to track changes.


use automation to secure its systems and network infrastructure = AWS CloudFormation

A startup company is hosting a website for its customers on an Amazon EC2 instance. The website consists of a stateless Python application and a MySQL database.
The website serves only a small amount of traffic. The company is concerned about the reliability of the instance and needs to migrate to a highly available
architecture. The company cannot modify the application code.

Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to achieve high availability for the website? (Choose two.)

A. Provision an internet gateway in each Availability Zone in use.
B. Migrate the database to an Amazon RDS for MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance. Most Voted
C. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB, and enable DynamoDB auto scaling.
D. Use AWS DataSync to synchronize the database data across multiple EC2 instances.
E. Create an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances that are distributed across two Availability Zones. Most Voted


A. no failed over mechanism and does not make sense with other options
C. DynamoDB is no SQL, cannot use with MySQL
D. Not HA, just sync/replication tools.


--------------------

A company is moving its data and applications to AWS during a multiyear migration project. The company wants to securely access data on Amazon S3
from the company's AWS Region and from the company's on-premises location. The data must not traverse the internet. The company has established
an AWS Direct Connect connection between its Region and its on-premises location.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create gateway endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the gateway endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on-premises location.
B. Create a gateway in AWS Transit Gateway to access Amazon S3 securely from the Region and the on-premises location.
C. Create interface endpoints for Amazon S3. Use the interface endpoints to securely access the data from the Region and the on-premises location. Most Voted
D. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key to access the data securely from the Region and the on-premises location.


Amazon S3 supports both gateway endpoints and interface endpoints. With a gateway endpoint, you can access Amazon S3 from your VPC, without 
requiring an internet gateway or NAT device for your VPC, and with no additional cost. 
However, gateway endpoints do not allow access from on-premises networks, from peered VPCs in other AWS Regions, or through a transit gateway.
For those scenarios, you must use an interface endpoint, which is available for an additional cost.



------------------------


A company created a new organization in AWS Organizations. The organization has multiple accounts for the company's development teams. The development team
members use AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS Single Sign-On) to access the accounts. For each of the company's applications, the development teams must use 
a predefined application name to tag resources that are created.

A solutions architect needs to design a solution that gives the development team the ability to create resources only if the application name tag has an approved value.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an IAM group that has a conditional Allow policy that requires the application name tag to be specified for resources to be created.
B. Create a cross-account role that has a Deny policy for any resource that has the application name tag.
C. Create a resource group in AWS Resource Groups to validate that the tags are applied to all resources in all accounts.
D. Create a tag policy in Organizations that has a list of allowed application names. Most Voted

A: Don't think this is possible.
B: Cross account role with deny policy? Never seen anything like this
C: Resource groups have nothing to do with allowed tags

A tag policy can also specify that noncompliant tagging operations on specified resource types are enforced. In other words, noncompliant 
tagging requests on specified resource types are prevented from completing.



-------------------------------


A company performs tests on an application that uses an Amazon DynamoDB table. The tests run for 4 hours once a week. The company knows how many 
read and write operations the application performs to the table each second during the tests. The company does not currently use DynamoDB for any
other use case. A solutions architect needs to optimize the costs for the table.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Choose on-demand mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately.
B. Choose provisioned mode. Update the read and write capacity units appropriately. Most Voted
C. Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 1-year term.
D. Purchase DynamoDB reserved capacity for a 3-year term.


With provisioned capacity mode, you specify the number of reads and writes per second that you expect your application to require,
and you are billed based on that. Furthermore if you can forecast your capacity requirements you can also reserve a portion of DynamoDB provisioned 
capacity and optimize your costs even further.

DynamoDB On-Demand pricing is about 6.94x the cost of provisioned capacity. If your applications have predictable traffic
patterns and you don't mind spending the time to understand those patterns, using DynamoDB's provisioned throughput capacity can save you money.

Provisioned Mode (Option B): Provisioned mode allows you to specify the desired read and write capacity units. Since the workload occurs once a week for 4 hours, 
you can provision the read and write capacity units accordingly to handle the expected load during that time. This can be a more cost-effective option than
on-demand pricing for predictable workloads.


--------------------------------------

A company runs its applications on Amazon EC2 instances. The company performs periodic financial assessments of its AWS costs. 
The company recently identified unusual spending.

The company needs a solution to prevent unusual spending. The solution must monitor costs and notify responsible stakeholders in the event of unusual spending.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use an AWS Budgets template to create a zero spend budget.
B. Create an AWS Cost Anomaly Detection monitor in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. Most Voted
C. Create AWS Pricing Calculator estimates for the current running workload pricing details.
D. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor costs and to identify unusual spending.



AWS Cost Anomaly Detection (Option B): AWS Cost Anomaly Detection is designed to automatically detect unusual spending patterns based on machine learning algorithms. 
It can identify anomalies and send notifications when it detects unexpected changes in spending. This aligns well with the requirement to prevent unusual
spending and notify stakeholders.


--------------------------

A company runs an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that the company frequently accesses for up to 7 days after the file 
creation date. After 7 days, the company needs to be able to access the files with a maximum retrieval time of 24 hours.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.
B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to increase the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days. Most Voted
C. Create an Amazon FSx File Gateway to increase the company's storage space. Create an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data after 7 days.
D. Configure access to Amazon S3 for each user. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.


A: DataSync is not used for this
C: FSx File Gateway requires NFS on both sides so won't work with S3
D: Doesn't say how to transfer data to S3
B: S3 File Gateway will connect SMB to S3. Lifecycle policy will move objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive which support 12 hours retrieval

A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group. The application uses a database that runs on an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL DB instance. 
The application performs slowly when traffic increases. The database experiences a heavy read load during periods of high traffic.

Which actions should a solutions architect take to resolve these performance issues? (Choose two.)

A. Turn on auto scaling for the DB instance.
B. Create a read replica for the DB instance. Configure the application to send read traffic to the read replica. Most Voted
C. Convert the DB instance to a Multi-AZ DB instance deployment. Configure the application to send read traffic to the standby DB instance.
D. Create an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Configure the application to cache query results in the ElastiCache cluster. Most Voted
E. Configure the Auto Scaling group subnets to ensure that the EC2 instances are provisioned in the same Availability Zone as the DB instance.


ans:
A: RDS DB instance Autoscaling is not a thing
C: You cannot read from standby even if this was done.
E: Does not solve any problem
Correct answer
B: Read replicas distribute load and help improving performance
D: Caching of any kind will help with performance

Remember: " The database experiences a heavy read load during periods of high traffic.



-------------------------


A company's application uses Network Load Balancers, Auto Scaling groups, Amazon EC2 instances, and databases that are deployed in an Amazon VPC. The company wants
to capture information about traffic to and from the network interfaces in near real time in its Amazon VPC. The company wants to send the information
to Amazon OpenSearch Service for analysis.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the log group. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to 
stream the logs from the log group to OpenSearch Service.
B. Create a log group in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the log group. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to
stream the logs from the log group to OpenSearch Service. Most Voted
C. Create a trail in AWS CloudTrail. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the trail. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams to stream the logs 
from the trail to OpenSearch Service.
D. Create a trail in AWS CloudTrail. Configure VPC Flow Logs to send the log data to the trail. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to stream the logs 
from the trail to OpenSearch Service.



CloudTrail is for logging administrative actions, we need CloudWatch. We want the data in another AWS service (OpenSearch),
not Kinesis, thus we need Firehose, not Streams.

Amazon CloudWatch Logs and VPC Flow Logs (Option B): VPC Flow Logs capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in a VPC



AWS provides CloudWatch and CloudTrail as monitoring and logging services, but they serve different purposes.

Feature	           Amazon CloudWatch	                                      AWS CloudTrail

A company is building a microservices-based application that will be deployed on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). The microservices will 
interact with each other. The company wants to ensure that the application is observable to identify performance issues in the future.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Configure the application to use Amazon ElastiCache to reduce the number of requests that are sent to the microservices.
B. Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to collect metrics from the EKS clusters. Configure AWS X-Ray to trace the requests between the microservices. Most Voted
C. Configure AWS CloudTrail to review the API calls. Build an Amazon QuickSight dashboard to observe the microservice interactions.
D. Use AWS Trusted Advisor to understand the performance of the application.

ans:

A - ElastiCache can reduce latency but does not directly provide observability.
B - CloudWatch Container Insights provides detailed metrics and logs for containers. AWS X-Ray traces requests across microservices
C - CloudTrail is designed for security auditing and API call tracking, not detailed observability or performance monitoring.
D - Trusted Advisor focuses on high-level recommendations and does not provide real-time observability for application interactions or performance issues.


----------------------------------

A company needs to provide customers with secure access to its data. The company processes customer data and stores the results in an Amazon S3 bucket.

All the data is subject to strong regulations and security requirements. The data must be encrypted at rest. Each customer must be able to access only their 
data from their AWS account. Company employees must not be able to access the data.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Provision an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for each customer. Encrypt the data client-side. In the private certificate policy, 
deny access to the certificate for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.
B. Provision a separate AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for each customer. Encrypt the data server-side. In the S3 bucket policy,
deny decryption of data for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.
C. Provision a separate AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key for each customer. Encrypt the data server-side. In each KMS key policy,
deny decryption of data for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides. Most Voted
D. Provision an AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for each customer. Encrypt the data client-side. In the public certificate policy,
deny access to the certificate for all principals except an IAM role that the customer provides.


ACM certificates are for securing communication (e.g., HTTPS/SSL), not for encrypting data at rest in S3. A and D are out.
Between B and C, they both create a separate key for each customer, and both work. So which is more cumbersome, managing S3 policies or managing KMS key policies?

Of course the latter one. In B, S3 bucket policy centralizes access rules for all keys, while in C, policies are distributed across individual keys. That's why I decide to choose B.

Actually I think neither B or C is correctly worded. If talking about key policy, should be "Modify the key's policy to grant the 
IAM user permissions for the kms:GenerateDataKey and kms:Decrypt actions at minimum."
If talking about bucket policy, should be "Deny GetObjects of particular customer without condition kms key equals 1234abcd...."

A company is developing an application that will run on a production Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) cluster. The EKS cluster has managed
node groups that are provisioned with On-Demand Instances.

The company needs a dedicated EKS cluster for development work. The company will use the development cluster infrequently to test the resiliency of the application. 
The EKS cluster must manage all the nodes.

Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Create a managed node group that contains only Spot Instances.
B. Create two managed node groups. Provision one node group with On-Demand Instances. Provision the second node group with Spot Instances. Most Voted
C. Create an Auto Scaling group that has a launch configuration that uses Spot Instances. Configure the user data to add the nodes to the EKS cluster.
D. Create a managed node group that contains only On-Demand Instances.

it is A

A node group is simply a collection of worker nodes (EC2 instances) that are managed together in an EKS cluster. Managed Node Groups are the best 
choice for most cases because AWS takes care of provisioning, scaling, and updates automatically. 

Types of Node Groups in EKS

There are two main types of node groups in EKS:
1️⃣ Managed Node Groups (Recommended)
Fully managed by AWS—EKS handles the provisioning, scaling, and updates.
Uses Amazon EC2 instances that are launched automatically into the cluster.
Supports both On-Demand and Spot Instances.
Integrated with AWS Auto Scaling, so it can scale nodes up or down as needed.
Requires no manual configuration—simpler to manage.
2️⃣ Self-Managed Node Groups
Nodes are manually created and managed by the user.
Requires setting up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) and configuring instances to join the cluster.
More flexible but requires more operational effort (e.g., upgrading instances manually).



In Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service), a managed node group is a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are automatically managed by AWS and 
used as worker nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.

When the option suggests "Create two managed node groups", it means:
One group of worker nodes will use On-Demand EC2 Instances (expensive but reliable).
The second group of worker nodes will use Spot Instances (cheaper but can be interrupted).

A company stores sensitive data in Amazon S3. A solutions architect needs to create an encryption solution. The company needs to fully control the ability
of users to create, rotate, and disable encryption keys with minimal effort for any data that must be encrypted.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use default server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) to store the sensitive data.
B. Create a customer managed key by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the new key to encrypt the S3 objects by using server-side encryption 
with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Most Voted
C. Create an AWS managed key by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Use the new key to encrypt the S3 objects by using server-side 
encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS).
D. Download S3 objects to an Amazon EC2 instance. Encrypt the objects by using customer managed keys. Upload the encrypted objects back into Amazon S3.



A and C do not allow the company "to fully control the ability of users to create, rotate, and disable encryption keys". D is anything but "minimal effort".




------------------------

A solutions architect needs to copy files from an Amazon S3 bucket to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file
system and another S3 bucket. The files must be copied continuously. New files 
are added to the original S3 bucket consistently. The copied files should be overwritten only if the source file changes.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create an AWS DataSync location for both the destination S3 bucket and the EFS file system. Create a task for the destination S3 bucket and
the EFS file system. Set the transfer mode to transfer only data that has changed. Most Voted
B. Create an AWS Lambda function. Mount the file system to the function. Set up an S3 event notification to invoke the function when files are created a
nd changed in Amazon S3. Configure the function to copy files to the file system and the destination S3 bucket.
C. Create an AWS DataSync location for both the destination S3 bucket and the EFS file system. Create a task for the destination S3 bucket and
the EFS file system. Set the transfer mode to transfer all data.
D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance in the same VPC as the file system. Mount the file system. Create a script to routinely synchronize all objects
that changed in the origin S3 bucket to the destination S3 bucket and the mounted file system.


AWS DataSync is designed for efficient and reliable copying of data between different storage solutions. By setting up an AWS DataSync task with the 
transfer mode set to transfer only data that has changed, you ensure that only the new or modified files are copied. This minimizes data transfer and operational overhead.

DataSync will do an Initial Scan of both S3 buckets. Identifying Differences. Then, Transferring Changes, so technically DataSync will transfer 
All the data at first run then it will only transfer newly added/modified objects subsequently.

A company copies 200 TB of data from a recent ocean survey onto AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices. The company has a high 
performance computing (HPC) cluster that is hosted on AWS to look for oil and gas deposits. A solutions architect must provide the
cluster with consistent sub-millisecond latency and high-throughput access to the data on the Snowball Edge Storage Optimized devices.
The company is sending the devices back to AWS.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Import the data into the S3 bucket. Configure an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to use the S3 bucket. Access 
the file gateway from the HPC cluster instances.
B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket. Import the data into the S3 bucket. Configure an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system, and integrate it with the S3 bucket. 
Access the FSx for Lustre file system from the HPC cluster instances. Most Voted
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Import the data into the S3 bucket. Copy the data from the S3 
bucket to the EFS file system. Access the EFS file system from the HPC cluster instances.
D. Create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. Import the data directly into the FSx for Lustre file system. Access the FSx for Lustre file system
from the HPC cluster instances.



ans:
No direct integration between Snowball and Fsx for Lustre. It must be via S3.
Snowball Edge (Storage Optimized) --> S3 --integrate--> FSx for Lustre

A company uses Amazon EC2 instances and stores data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. The company must ensure that all data is
encrypted at rest by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The company must be able to control rotation of the encryption keys.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create a customer managed key. Use the key to encrypt the EBS volumes. Most Voted
B. Use an AWS managed key to encrypt the EBS volumes. Use the key to configure automatic key rotation.
C. Create an external KMS key with imported key material. Use the key to encrypt the EBS volumes.
D. Use an AWS owned key to encrypt the EBS volumes.


"Able to control rotation of the encryption keys" = customer managed key (created by AWS but managed by the customer in KMS)

A company wants to migrate its web applications from on premises to AWS. The company is located close to the eu-central-1 Region. Because of 
regulations, the company cannot launch some of its applications in eu-central-1. The company wants to achieve single-digit millisecond latency.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to an edge location in Amazon CloudFront.
B. Deploy the applications in AWS Local Zones by extending the company's VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Local Zone. Most Voted
C. Deploy the applications in eu-central-1. Extend the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to the regional edge caches in Amazon CloudFront.
D. Deploy the applications in AWS Wavelength Zones by extending the company’s VPC from eu-central-1 to the chosen Wavelength Zone.


AC is not right "Because of regulations, the company cannot launch some of its applications in eu-central-1"
D: AWS Wavelength is for mobile network
B: Local Zones can be used to launch apps close to a region but not in a region like EUC1 so this works

AWS Local Zones place AWS compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to end-users. This would allow the company to deploy 
applications within geographic proximity to eu-central-1 without being directly in the region, potentially meeting regulatory requirements and achieving low latency.

A company regularly uploads GB-sized files to Amazon S3. After the company uploads the files, the company uses a fleet of Amazon EC2 Spot Instances to 
transcode the file format. The company needs to scale throughput when the company uploads data from the on-premises data center to Amazon S3 and
when the company downloads data from Amazon S3 to the EC2 instances.

Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Use the S3 bucket access point instead of accessing the S3 bucket directly.
B. Upload the files into multiple S3 buckets.
C. Use S3 multipart uploads. Most Voted
D. Fetch multiple byte-ranges of an object in parallel. Most Voted
E. Add a random prefix to each object when uploading the files.


C: Increase the file upload throughput
D: increase the file download throughput

A solutions architect is designing a shared storage solution for a web application that is deployed across multiple Availability Zones. The web application 
runs on Amazon EC2 instances that are in an Auto Scaling group. The company plans to make frequent changes to the content. The solution must have strong
consistency in returning the new content as soon as the changes occur.

Which solutions meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Use AWS Storage Gateway Volume Gateway Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) block storage that is mounted to the individual EC2 instances.
B. Create an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Mount the EFS file system on the individual EC2 instances. Most Voted
C. Create a shared Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. Mount the EBS volume on the individual EC2 instances.
D. Use AWS DataSync to perform continuous synchronization of data between EC2 hosts in the Auto Scaling group.
E. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the web content. Set the metadata for the Cache-Control header to no-cache. Use Amazon CloudFront to deliver the content. Most Voted


A - Volume Gateway is typically on-prem and optimized for hybrid setups, not for fully cloud-based solutions.
B - EFS provides a fully managed, shared file storage system that works across multiple AZs.
C - Even with Multi-Attach, sharing EBS volumes across AZs is pretty complex and error-prone.
D - DataSync is designed for periodic synchronization and not real-time, frequent updates.
E - The "no-cache" header ensures the content is always fetched fresh, and CloudFront delivers it efficiently with reduced latency. 
Although S3 is less efficient for frequent updates compared to a shared file system like EFS, but not a problem here.

A company is deploying an application in three AWS Regions using an Application Load Balancer. Amazon Route 53 will be used to distribute traffic between these Regions.

Which Route 53 configuration should a solutions architect use to provide the MOST high-performing experience?

A. Create an A record with a latency policy. Most Voted
B. Create an A record with a geolocation policy.
C. Create a CNAME record with a failover policy.
D. Create a CNAME record with a geoproximity policy.


create an ALB and create a DNS record in Route53. While you can technically use a CNAME (for subdomains, see below), the wizard will guide 
you to use an A ALIAS record, which also makes the most sense.

The problem with CNAME records is that it's not possible to create them at the root level of the domain. Let's say your domain is 
somedomain.com - you can't create a CNAME for the apex of the domain (mydomain.com), only for subdomains (subdomain.mydomain.com).

A company is moving its on-premises Oracle database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL. The database has several applications that write to the same tables. The
applications need to be migrated one by one with a month in between each migration. Management has expressed concerns that the database has a high number 
of reads and writes. The data must be kept in sync across both databases throughout the migration.

What should a solutions architect recommend?

A. Use AWS DataSync for the initial migration. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create a change data capture (CDC) replication task 
and a table mapping to select all tables.
B. Use AWS DataSync for the initial migration. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) to create a full load plus change data capture (CDC) 
replication task and a table mapping to select all tables.
C. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) using a memory optimized replication instance. Create a full
load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select all tables. Most Voted
D. Use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool with AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) using a compute optimized replication instance. Create a full 
load plus change data capture (CDC) replication task and a table mapping to select the largest tables.


ans: C
AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) supports heterogeneous database migrations by automatically converting the source database schema and a majority 
of the custom code to a format compatible with the target database.
A memory-optimized replication instance is recommended because the database has a high number of reads and writes. Memory-optimized instances
are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

A company runs a three-tier application in a VPC. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance.

The company plans to migrate the RDS for MySQL DB instance to an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster. The company needs a solution that replicates 
the data changes that happen during the migration to the new database.

Which combination of steps will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) Schema Conversion to transform the database objects. Most Voted
B. Use AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) Schema Conversion to create an Aurora PostgreSQL read replica on the RDS for MySQL DB instance.
C. Configure an Aurora MySQL read replica for the RDS for MySQL DB instance.
D. Define an AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) task with change data capture (CDC) to migrate the data. Most Voted
E. Promote the Aurora PostgreSQL read replica to a standalone Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster when the replica lag is zero.


ans: 
A: Correct. because need convert from MySQL to PostgreSQL
B: Wrong. Schema Conversion does not create an Aurora read replica
C: Wrong. Company wants to migrate to Aurora PostgreSQL, not Aurora MySQL
D: Correct. CDC task helps to capture ongoing change from source data store
E: Wrong. Although using Aurora Read Replica is an option for DB migration within the same Region, this question is asking for "combination of steps", 
which this option does not have another compatible option to pair with

A company is designing a web application on AWS. The application will use a VPN connection between the company’s existing data centers and the company's VPCs.
The company uses Amazon Route 53 as its DNS service. The application must use private DNS records to communicate with the on-premises services from a VPC.

Which solution will meet these requirements in the MOST secure manner?

A. Create a Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC. Most Voted
B. Create a Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoint. Create a resolver rule. Associate the resolver rule with the VPC.
C. Create a Route 53 private hosted zone. Associate the private hosted zone with the VPC.
D. Create a Route 53 public hosted zone. Create a record for each service to allow service communication



Inbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries to your VPC from your on-premises network or another VPC.
Outbound Resolver endpoints allow DNS queries from your VPC to your on-premises network or another VPC.

Resolver rules enable you to create one forwarding rule for each domain name and specify the name of the domain for which you
want to forward DNS queries from your VPC to an on-premises DNS resolver and from your on-premises to your VPC. Rules are 
applied directly to your VPC and can be shared across multiple accounts.

A company runs a highly available web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. 
The company uses Amazon CloudWatch metrics.

As the traffic to the web application increases, some EC2 instances become overloaded with many outstanding requests. The CloudWatch metrics
show that the number of requests processed and the time to receive the responses from some EC2 instances are both higher compared to other EC2 instances.
The company does not want new requests to be forwarded to the EC2 instances that are already overloaded.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use the round robin routing algorithm based on the RequestCountPerTarget and ActiveConnectionCount CloudWatch metrics.
B. Use the least outstanding requests algorithm based on the RequestCountPerTarget and ActiveConnectionCount CloudWatch metrics. 
C. Use the round robin routing algorithm based on the RequestCount and TargetResponseTime CloudWatch metrics.
D. Use the least outstanding requests algorithm based on the RequestCount and TargetResponseTime CloudWatch metrics.



sol:
Option B is correct because can use "RequestCountPerTarget" to identify the amount of requests for each EC2 instance. Then use "least outstanding 
requests algorithm" to route to targets with the lowest number of in progress requests.

Option D is wrong because "RequestCount" cannot identify the amount of requests for each EC2 instance. "RequestCount" is for the whole ALB.

A company uses Amazon EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda to run multiple workloads in the company's AWS account. The company wants to fully make
use of its Compute Savings Plans. The company wants to receive notification when coverage of the Compute Savings Plans drops.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?

A. Create a daily budget for the Savings Plans by using AWS Budgets. Configure the budget with a coverage threshold to send notifications to
the appropriate email message recipients. Most Voted
B. Create a Lambda function that runs a coverage report against the Savings Plans. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to email the

A company runs a real-time data ingestion solution on AWS. The solution consists of the most recent version of Amazon Managed Streaming 
for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK). The solution is deployed in a VPC in private subnets across three Availability Zones.

A solutions architect needs to redesign the data ingestion solution to be publicly available over the internet. 
The data in transit must also be encrypted.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the MOST operational efficiency?

A. Configure public subnets in the existing VPC. Deploy an MSK cluster in the public subnets. Update the MSK cluster security settings to
enable mutual TLS authentication. Most Voted
B. Create a new VPC that has public subnets. Deploy an MSK cluster in the public subnets. Update the MSK cluster security settings 
to enable mutual TLS authentication.
C. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses private subnets. Configure an ALB security group inbound rule to allow inbound 
traffic from the VPC CIDR block for HTTPS protocol.
D. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) that uses private subnets. Configure an NLB listener for HTTPS communication over the internet.



A
Explanation: In this solution, the MSK cluster is deployed in public subnets of the existing VPC, making it accessible over the internet. 
The use of mutual TLS authentication ensures that data in transit is encrypted, which is one of the requirements.
Operational Efficiency: This is a reasonable approach for making MSK publicly available while maintaining security through mutual TLS.
However, there could be additional complexity in managing the VPC's public subnet configuration, security groups, and other
resources related to internet accessibility. Still, it leverages the existing infrastructure and avoids creating a new VPC.

B
Explanation: This approach involves creating an entirely new VPC with public subnets for the MSK cluster, making it accessible from 
the internet. Mutual TLS encryption is used to secure the data in transit.
Operational Efficiency: This option introduces more complexity since it requires setting up a completely new VPC, configuring the 
public subnets, and managing a separate MSK cluster. While it achieves the same security and availability goals, it creates additional
operational overhead compared to Option A (which leverages the existing VPC).

C
Explanation: In this solution, an ALB is deployed in private subnets, which means the ALB itself would not be directly
accessible from the internet. Additionally, configuring it to accept traffic only from the VPC CIDR block does not meet 
the requirement to make the data ingestion publicly available over the internet.
Operational Efficiency: The approach doesn't fully meet the requirements (especially regarding public accessibility). Using an
ALB in private subnets also introduces unnecessary complexity for the desired solution. Therefore, this option is not ideal.

D
Explanation: This option suggests deploying an NLB in private subnets and using an HTTPS listener to handle communication
over the internet. However, placing the NLB in private subnets would make it inaccessible from the internet, which does not 
meet the requirement of making the data ingestion publicly available.
Operational Efficiency: Similar to Option C, this doesn't meet the requirement for public availability, and using an NLB in private 
subnets adds unnecessary complexity for a solution that needs to be internet-facing. Therefore, this option is also not suitable.

A company is designing a new multi-tier web application that consists of the following components:

• Web and application servers that run on Amazon EC2 instances as part of Auto Scaling groups
• An Amazon RDS DB instance for data storage

A solutions architect needs to limit access to the application servers so that only the web servers can access them.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy AWS PrivateLink in front of the application servers. Configure the network ACL to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.
B. Deploy a VPC endpoint in front of the application servers. Configure the security group to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.
C. Deploy a Network Load Balancer with a target group that contains the application servers' Auto Scaling group. Configure 
the network ACL to allow only the web servers to access the application servers.
D. Deploy an Application Load Balancer with a target group that contains the application servers' Auto Scaling group. Configure
the security group to allow only the web servers to access the application servers. Most Voted

D is the answer!



-----------------


A company operates a two-tier application for image processing. The application uses two Availability Zones, each with one public subnet and one private
subnet. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) for the web tier uses the public subnets. Amazon EC2 instances for the application tier use the private subnets.

Users report that the application is running more slowly than expected. A security audit of the web server log files shows that the application is 
receiving millions of illegitimate requests from a small number of IP addresses. A solutions architect needs to resolve the immediate performance
problem while the company investigates a more permanent solution.

What should the solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

A. Modify the inbound security group for the web tier. Add a deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.
B. Modify the network ACL for the web tier subnets. Add an inbound deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources. Most Voted
C. Modify the inbound security group for the application tier. Add a deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.
D. Modify the network ACL for the application tier subnets. Add an inbound deny rule for the IP addresses that are consuming resources.


A: Wrong as SG cannot deny. By default everything is deny in SG and you allow stuff
CD: App tier is not under attack so these are irrelevant options
B: Correct as NACL is exactly for this access control list to define rules for CIDR or IP addresses



***********
Security Groups (SG)
Purpose:
Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances. They control which inbound and outbound traffic is allowed to reach your EC2 instances.
Key Characteristics:
Stateful: If you allow inbound traffic, the response (outbound) is automatically allowed, even if there is no outbound rule for it.
Level: Applied at the instance level. Each EC2 instance can have multiple security groups.
Rule Type: Can only allow traffic. Cannot block traffic; if a traffic type is not allowed by any rule, it is implicitly denied.



Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
Purpose:
Network ACLs are used to control traffic at the subnet level. They allow you to specify rules for both inbound 
and outbound traffic and apply to all resources within a subnet.

Key Characteristics:
Stateless: You must explicitly define both inbound and outbound rules. Traffic will not be automatically allowed to return (like in SGs). 
You need both rules to allow two-way communication.
Level: Applied at the subnet level. A single NACL affects all resources in a subnet (like EC2, RDS, etc.).
Rule Type: Can both allow and deny traffic, providing finer control over which traffic is blocked.
Default Behavior: By default, new NACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic unless modified. You can configure deny rules to block unwanted traffic.
Effect on Subnet: NACLs are useful to create security boundaries between subnets.

When to Use:
Use NACLs when you want to block specific types of traffic (using deny rules) or control the flow of traffic at the subnet level (e.g., between public and private subnets).




Route Table (RT)
Purpose:
Route Tables control where traffic is directed within a VPC. They are responsible for determining the next hop for network traffic.

Key Characteristics:
Defines traffic flow: Determines where traffic should go based on destination IP addresses.
Level: Works at the subnet level and applies to all resources within the subnet.
State: It is stateless, meaning no memory of previous requests. For every new request, it needs to check the route.
Default Routes: Usually has a default route (0.0.0.0/0) that directs traffic to an Internet Gateway (IGW), NAT Gateway, or VPN Gateway.
No Allow/Deny Rules: Route tables don't allow you to specify rules to allow or deny traffic; they simply determine the direction of traffic.

When to Use:
Use route tables when you need to control the network traffic direction. For example, route traffic from a private subnet through a NAT 
Gateway or route traffic from the public subnet through an Internet Gateway.

A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances are in private subnets. A solutions 
architect implements an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) and specifies the EC2 instances as the target group. However, the
internet traffic is not reaching the EC2 instances.

How should the solutions architect reconfigure the architecture to resolve this issue?

A. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer. Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet to allow internet traffic.
B. Move the EC2 instances to public subnets. Add a rule to the EC2 instances’ security groups to allow outbound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.
C. Update the route tables for the EC2 instances’ subnets to send 0.0.0.0/0 traffic through the internet gateway route. Add a rule to
the EC2 instances’ security groups to allow outbound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0.
D. Create public subnets in each Availability Zone. Associate the public subnets with the ALB. Update the route tables for the public
subnets with a route to the private subnets.



ans:
A - Might be possible but it's quite impractical
B - Not needed as the setup described should work as is provided the SGs of the EC2 instances accept traffic from the ALB
C - Update the route tables for the EC2 instances’ subnets to send 0.0.0.0/0 traffic through the internet gateway route - not needed as the EC2
instances would receive the traffic from the ALB ENIs. Add a rule to the EC2 instances’ security groups to allow outbound traffic to 0.0.0.0/0 - 
the default behaviour of the SG is to allow outbound traffic only.
D - Create public subnets in each Availability Zone. Associate the public subnets with the ALB - if it's a internet facing ALB these should already
be in place. Update the route tables for the public subnets with a route to the private subnets - no need 
as the local prefix entry in the route tables would take care of this point

I'm 110% sure the question or answers or both are wrong. Prove me wrong! :)
Completely agreed, I was looking for an option to allow HTTPS traffic on port 443 from the ALB to the EC2 instance's security group.
Either the question or the answers are wrong.

A company wants to migrate an on-premises legacy application to AWS. The application ingests customer order files from an on-premises enterprise resource
planning (ERP) system. The application then uploads the files to an SFTP server. The application uses a scheduled job that checks for order files every hour.

The company already has an AWS account that has connectivity to the on-premises network. The new application on AWS must support integration 
with the existing ERP system. The new application must be secure and resilient and must use the SFTP protocol to process orders from the ERP system immediately.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internet-facing server in two Availability Zones. Use Amazon S3 storage. Create an AWS Lambda
function to process order files. Use S3 Event Notifications to send s3:ObjectCreated:* events to the Lambda function.
B. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internet-facing server in one Availability Zone. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage.
Create an AWS Lambda function to process order files. Use a Transfer Family managed workflow to invoke the Lambda function.
C. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internal server in two Availability Zones. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) storage. 
Create an AWS Step Functions state machine to process order files. Use Amazon EventBridge Scheduler to invoke the state
machine to periodically check Amazon EFS for order files.
D. Create an AWS Transfer Family SFTP internal server in two Availability Zones. Use Amazon S3 storage. Create
an AWS Lambda function to process order files. Use a Transfer Family managed workflow to invoke the Lambda function. 


sol:
D looks more secure over existing on-prem to AWS connection
-Transfer Family SFTP internal server in two Availability Zones.
-Use Amazon S3 storage.
-Use a Transfer Family managed workflow to invoke the Lambda function"

A and D are similar, but A internet-facing server is less secure than D, also no need to use S3 Event Notifications to send s3:ObjectCreated:*
events to the Lambda function because Transfer Family managed workflows can directly invoke Lambda..

A and B is out since it is public facing and we don't need public facing SFTP since Company already have Connection to AWS thro ON-PREMISES.
Initially i thought it will C since it was doing scheduled as they were doing scheduled job every hour on on-premises. Then the read thro question
and saw they are saying with new solution, they want to process the file immediately after it is uploaded so D is correct since it will trigger
the Lambda file as soon as file appears on S3.

Why AWS Lambda is the Best Fit:
Serverless: AWS Lambda is fully serverless, meaning you don’t have to manage any infrastructure, which aligns with the requirement to minimize operational support.
Automatic Scaling: Lambda automatically scales in response to incoming traffic, so you don’t need to configure auto-scaling groups or manage instances.
Python Support: AWS Lambda supports Python, so you can easily run your Python code without additional configuration.
Event-driven: Lambda is designed for microservices and can be triggered by events (such as HTTP requests through Amazon API Gateway) with minimal setup.

Why Elastic Beanstalk May Not Be Ideal:
While Elastic Beanstalk provides an easy way to deploy and manage applications, it's not fully serverless. Here's why it might not 
meet the "minimal infrastructure" and "serverless" requirements as effectively as Lambda:
Infrastructure Management: Elastic Beanstalk still requires you to manage and scale EC2 instances behind the scenes, which means there
is more infrastructure to manage compared to Lambda, where you only focus on your application code.
Scaling Complexity: Elastic Beanstalk automatically scales, but it still relies on EC2 instances (even with auto-scaling), which 
introduces complexity in terms of instance management and cost optimization. Lambda automatically scales without needing to provision instances.
More Overhead: You need to configure things like load balancing, health checks, and instance scaling within Elastic Beanstalk. This adds c
omplexity compared to Lambda's "just code" approach.

Other Options Breakdown:
A. Spot Fleet with Auto Scaling of EC2 instances: This would be more complex to manage, especially for serverless requirements, since 
you're still managing EC2 instances (including their scaling).
B. Elastic Beanstalk (correct answer) with High Availability: Good for simplifying infrastructure, but still involves EC2, which isn't the most optimal
for a serverless microservices approach.
C. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): This involves a significant amount of operational overhead, especially for scaling, managing pods,
and ensuring availability. It's not the simplest solution for a serverless, microservices architecture.




-------------------------------
A company has applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The EC2 instances connect to Amazon RDS databases by using an IAM role that has 
associated policies. The company wants to use AWS Systems Manager to patch the EC2 instances without disrupting the running applications.

Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create a new IAM role. Attach the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to the new IAM role. Attach the new IAM role to the EC2 instances and the existing IAM role.
B. Create an IAM user. Attach the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to the IAM user. Configure Systems Manager to use the IAM user to manage the EC2 instances.
C. Enable Default Host Configuration Management in Systems Manager to manage the EC2 instances. Most Voted
D. Remove the existing policies from the existing IAM role. Add the AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy to the existing IAM role.


ans:

"Attach the new IAM role to the EC2 instances and the existing IAM role" - You can't attach multiple policies to an EC2 instance. So A is wrong.
IAM users are typically used for human access or API-based access, but EC2 instances require IAM roles, not IAM users. Systems
Manager must have a role attached to the instances, not a user, to work with EC2 instances.

Host Configuration Management enables automated patch management and maintenance, allowing EC2 instances 
to be patched without affecting running applications.
It ensures that necessary patches and updates are applied efficiently by Systems Manager, and minimizes any potential 
disruptions to application performance during the patching process.

 AWS Systems Manager (Session Manager) provides a secure, efficient, and scalable method to connect to your EC2 instances without requiring open
SSH or RDP ports, making it an excellent choice for managing EC2 instances, especially in highly secure environments.


Session Manager (Optional)

If you don’t want to open SSH or RDP ports to the internet, you can use AWS Systems Manager's Session Manager to connect securely without opening ports.

Steps to Use Session Manager:
Ensure EC2 Instance has the necessary IAM Role:
The instance must have an IAM role with AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore policy attached.

Verify SSM Agent is Installed:
The SSM agent should be installed on your EC2 instance (for Amazon Linux 2, it comes pre-installed).

sudo systemctl status amazon-ssm-agent //If it’s running, the agent is installed and operational

sudo yum install -y amazon-ssm-agent//to install 

Connect via Session Manager:
Go to the EC2 Console, select your instance, and choose Connect.
Select Session Manager under connection type and click Connect.
This will open a browser-based terminal to manage your instance securely.
