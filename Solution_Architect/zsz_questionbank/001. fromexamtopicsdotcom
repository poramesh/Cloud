1. A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the 
company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. 
The solution must minimize operational complexity.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.
B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.
C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region
Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.



A. is correct because S3 Transfer Acceleration is support for high speed transfer in Edge location and you can upload it immediately.
Also with multipart uploads your big file can be uploaded in parallel.
B, C, D. is not minimize operational and fast when compare to answer A

what is transfer accelaration?
Uses CloudFront edge locations to speed up uploads.
Reduces latency by using a geographically closer edge location for uploading.
Best for remote locations far from the S3 bucket.

2. A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Use Amazon Redshift to load all the content into one place and run the SQL queries as needed.
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store the logs. Run SQL queries as needed from the Amazon CloudWatch console.
C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed. Most Voted
D. Use AWS Glue to catalog the logs. Use a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR to run the SQL queries as needed.

C is correct, Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using
standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard 
SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.

3. A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that
contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.
B. Create an organizational unit (OU) for each department. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.
C. Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the CreateAccount, InviteAccountToOrganization, LeaveOrganization, and RemoveAccountFromOrganization 
events. Update the S3 bucket policy accordingly.
D. Tag each user that needs access to the S3 bucket. Add the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.



aws:PrincipalOrgID Validates if the principal accessing the resource belongs to an account in your organization.

4. An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs 
to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet.
Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.
B. Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket.
C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access.
D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint.


answer is A 
If accessing S3/DynamoDB privately: Use a Gateway VPC Endpoint.
If accessing any other AWS service privately: Use an Interface Endpoint (via PrivateLink).
If accessing third-party SaaS applications or services in another account/VPC: Use PrivateLink


((((((
There are two main types of VPC Endpoints:
Gateway Endpoint
Works only for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
Uses route tables to direct traffic.
Free to use (no data transfer costs).

Interface Endpoint
Works for most AWS services (e.g., SSM, Secrets Manager, EC2 API, Lambda, etc.).
Uses AWS PrivateLink (creates an elastic network interface inside the VPC).
Not free â€“ incurs per-hour and data processing charges.

5. A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. 
For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, 
placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they 
could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?

A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents
B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server



Ebs doesnt support cross az only reside in one Az but Efs does, that why it's c

here we start off by copying the current data from ebs to efs and now we modify it to save directly in the amaozn efs.

6. A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. 
The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video 
files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an S3 bucket. Create an IAM role that has permissions to write to the S3 bucket. Use the AWS CLI to copy
all files locally to the S3 bucket.
B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return 
the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.
C. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public service endpoint to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new
NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.
D. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public
virtual interface (VIF) to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new
file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.

sol:
B. On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less 
than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send
it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.

C. File Gateway uses the Internet, so maximum speed will be at most 1Gbps, so it'll take a minimum of 6.5 days and you use 70TB of Internet bandwidth.

D. You can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbps with Direct Connect. Total time 15.5 hours and you will use 70TB of bandwidth. However, what's
interesting is that the question does not specific what type of bandwidth? Direct Connect does not use your Internet bandwidth, as you will 
have a dedicate peer to peer connectivity between your on-prem and the AWS Cloud, so technically, you're not using your "public" bandwidth.

The requirements are a bit too vague but I think that B is the most appropriate answer, although D might also be correct if the bandwidth usage
refers strictly to your public connectivity.


Capacities and Scales of snowball:
Snowball: 50-80 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowball Edge: 100 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowmobile: Up to 100 petabytes (exabyte scale).
snowcone: less than 8 TN

7. A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages.
The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second.
The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.
B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.
C. Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages 
and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages.
D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions.
Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

ans: 
Amazon SNS + SQS provides a scalable and decoupled architecture:
SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service that allows the ingestion application to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers.
SQS acts as the subscriber to the SNS topic, creating separate message queues for each consumer application. This ensures:
Scalability: Messages are distributed across queues, decoupling the producer and consumers.
Reliability: SQS queues store messages until consumer applications can process them, accommodating sudden spikes in message volume.

8. A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary
server that coordinates jobs across multiple compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes resiliency and scalability.
How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?

A. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances 
that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling to use scheduled scaling.
B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances 
that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.
C. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure AWS CloudTrail
as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the primary server.
D. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure Amazon EventBridge
(Amazon CloudWatch Events) as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the compute nodes.

ans:
1.Amazon SQS for Decoupling:
Amazon SQS provides a fully managed message queue to decouple the primary server from the compute nodes. Jobs are sent to the queue, and
compute nodes process them independently.
This architecture eliminates a single point of failure (the primary server) and increases resilience.

2.Auto Scaling Group for Compute Nodes:
EC2 instances managed in an Auto Scaling group process the jobs in the SQS queue. Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of 
instances based on the queue size, ensuring scalability to handle variable workloads.

3.Scalability Based on Queue Size:
Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue ensures that the system adjusts to workload demands efficiently. When the queue grows,
more instances are launched; when the queue shrinks, instances are terminated.


C, D - incorrect: Primary server should not be in same Auto Scaling group with compute nodes.
ASGs are designed for stateless, replaceable compute nodes (e.g., web servers, worker nodes).
If an instance in an ASG fails or is unhealthy, the ASG automatically terminates and replaces it.
Problem: If the primary server (e.g., a database or stateful service) is in the ASG, it could be unintentionally terminated and replaced, leading to data loss or service disruption.
âœ… Best Practice: The primary server should be a separate dedicated instance or managed service (e.g., Amazon RDS for databases).

Compute nodes (web servers, worker nodes, etc.) are stateless, meaning they process tasks without storing persistent data.
Primary servers (databases, controllers, etc.) are stateful, meaning they maintain critical data and connections.
Problem: If the primary server is in an ASG, it may be terminated and restarted without preserving its state, leading to data corruption.

9. A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few 
days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.
The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available 
storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle
management to avoid future storage issues.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.
B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data
to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days. Most Voted
C. Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system to extend the company's storage space.
D. Install a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 
Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.



ans:
Correct answer is B.
Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud to store application data files and backup images as durable 
objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage. Amazon S3 File Gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.
It can be used for on-premises data-intensive Amazon EC2-based applications that need file protocol access to S3 object storage. 
Lifecycle policies can then transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

The S3 File Gateway allows you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using standard file system protocols, such as SMB and NFS.
This would provide additional storage space for the company's data and allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files,
as the data would still be stored on the SMB file server.

Option A, using AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS, would not provide additional storage space
for the company's data and would not allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files.

Option C, creating an FSx for Windows File Server file system, would provide additional storage space but would not include file lifecycle management.

Option D, installing a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3 and creating an S3 Lifecycle policy, would not 
provide additional storage space on the company's file server.

10. A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST
API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use an API Gateway integration to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the application receives an order. 
Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the topic to perform processing.
B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order.
Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.
C. Use an API Gateway authorizer to block any requests while the application processes an order.
D. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue when the application receives an order.
Configure the SQS standard queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.

11. A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database
by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.
B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation.
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store objects that are encrypted with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Migrate the credential 
file to the S3 bucket. Point the application to the S3 bucket.
D. Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for each EC2 instance. Attach the new EBS volume to each EC2 instance. Migrate 
the credential file to the new EBS volume. Point the application to the new EBS volume.



ans:
B is wrong because parameter store does not support auto rotation, unless the customer writes it themselves, A is the answer.

12. A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and 
dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and 
dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route
53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the 
S3 bucket as an endpoint Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has 
the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name 
as an endpoint for the web application.
D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint.
Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS 
name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.


ans:
Answer is A
Explanation - AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
â€¢ They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
â€¢ Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
CloudFront
â€¢ Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
â€¢ Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
â€¢ Content is served at the edge
Global Accelerator
â€¢ Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
â€¢ Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
â€¢ Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
â€¢ Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
â€¢ Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

A. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Secrets Manager. Use multi-Region secret replication for the required Regions.
Configure Secrets Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
B. Store the credentials as secrets in AWS Systems Manager by creating a secure string parameter. Use multi-Region secret replication 
for the required Regions. Configure Systems Manager to rotate the secrets on a schedule.
C. Store the credentials in an Amazon S3 bucket that has server-side encryption (SSE) enabled. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) 
to invoke an AWS Lambda function to rotate the credentials.
D. Encrypt the credentials as secrets by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) multi-Region customer managed keys.
Store the secrets in an Amazon DynamoDB global table. Use an AWS Lambda function to retrieve the secrets from DynamoDB. Use the RDS API to rotate the secrets.

14. A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon 
EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. 
The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.
The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions.
The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality.
B. Use Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment Configure Amazon RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone.
C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances.


ans: 
C, AURORA is 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS and handles more read requests than write,; maintaining high availability = Multi-AZ deployment

Option C, using Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment and configuring Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas,
would be the best solution to meet the requirements.
Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL-compatible relational database that is designed for high performance and high availability. 
Aurora Multi-AZ deployments automatically maintain a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone to provide
high availability. Additionally, Aurora Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale the number of Aurora Replicas in response to read workloads, 
allowing you to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability. This would provide an automated solution
for scaling the database to meet the demand of the application while maintaining high availability.

Option A, using Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality, would not provide high availability.
Option B, using Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment and configuring RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone, would not 
provide high availability and would not automatically scale the number of reader instances in response to read workloads.
Option D, using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances, would not provide a database solution and would not meet the requirements

15. A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out of the production VPC. 
The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as traffic flow inspection 
and traffic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon GuardDuty for traffic inspection and traffic filtering in the production VPC.
B. Use Traffic Mirroring to mirror traffic from the production VPC for traffic inspection and filtering.
C. Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
D. Use AWS Firewall Manager to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.



ans:
option C: Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
AWS Network Firewall is a managed firewall service that provides filtering for both inbound and outbound network traffic. 
It allows you to create rules for traffic inspection and filtering, which can help protect your production VPC.

Option A: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service, not a traffic inspection or filtering service.
Option B: Traffic Mirroring is a feature that allows you to replicate and send a copy of network traffic from a VPC to another VPC or 
on-premises location. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.
Option D: AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps you to centrally configure and manage firewalls 
across your accounts. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.

16. A company hosts a data lake on AWS. The data lake consists of data in Amazon S3 and Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. The company needs a reporting 
solution that provides data visualization and includes all the data sources within the data lake. Only the company's management team should
have full access to all the visualizations. The rest of the company should have only limited access.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. 
Share the dashboards with the appropriate IAM roles.
B. Create an analysis in Amazon QuickSight. Connect all the data sources and create new datasets. Publish dashboards to visualize the data. 
Share the dashboards with the appropriate users and groups.
C. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Create an AWS Glue extract, transform, and load (ETL) job to produce reports.
Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.
D. Create an AWS Glue table and crawler for the data in Amazon S3. Use Amazon Athena Federated Query to access data within Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL. 
Generate reports by using Amazon Athena. Publish the reports to Amazon S3. Use S3 bucket policies to limit access to the reports.


ans:
The question requires a solution for data visualization, which means it focuses solely on downstream consumption. Therefore, any solution that
includes upstream processing is off the table (C & D). This leaves us with two options: A and B. Essentially, they are the same with one 
key difference: A manages access through IAM Roles, while B manages it through an IAM group. Since only the management team is granted 
permission, using a group will be more efficient, as it scales better with changes in personnel and provides a centralized point for managing permissions.

Keyword: data visualization = QuickSight
QuickSight defines Users (standard versions) and Groups (enterprise version)
These users & groups only exist within QuickSight, not IAM
So the correct answer is B.

A - Incorrect: Amazon QuickSight only support users(standard version) and groups (enterprise version). users and groups 
only exists without QuickSight. QuickSight don't support IAM. We use users and groups to view the QuickSight dashboard
B - Correct: as explained in answer A and QuickSight is used to created dashboard from S3, RDS, Redshift,
Aurora, Athena, OpenSearch, Timestream
C - Incorrect: This way don't support visulization and don't mention how to process RDS data
D - Incorrect: This way don't support visulization and don't mention how to combine data RDS and S3

17. A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an
Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket.
What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.
B. Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances.
C. Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances.
D. Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances.

ans:
The correct option to meet this requirement is A: Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket and attach the role to the EC2 instances.
An IAM role is an AWS resource that allows you to delegate access to AWS resources and services. You can create an IAM role
that grants access to the S3 bucket and then attach the role to the EC2 instances. This will allow the EC2 instances to access the
S3 bucket and the documents stored within it.

Option B is incorrect because an IAM policy is used to define permissions for an IAM user or group, not for an EC2 instance.
Option C is incorrect because an IAM group is used to group together IAM users and policies, not to grant access to resources.
Option D is incorrect because an IAM user is used to represent a person or service that interacts with AWS resources, not to grant access to resources.

Always remember that you should associate IAM roles to EC2 instances

18. An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images.
When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and 
compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket.
A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically.
Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue 
when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.
B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source.
When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.
C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name
to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.
D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, 
log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.
E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an 
Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.


ans:
To design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process images automatically, a solutions architect could consider the following actions:
Option A involves creating an SQS queue and configuring the S3 bucket to send a notification to the queue when an image is uploaded. 
This allows the application to decouple the image upload process from the image processing process and ensures that the image processing
process is triggered automatically when a new image is uploaded.
Option B involves configuring the Lambda function to use the SQS queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed,
the message is deleted from the queue. This ensures that the Lambda function is invoked only once per image and that the image is not processed multiple times.
Option C is incorrect because it involves storing state (the file name) in memory, which is not a durable or scalable solution.
Option D is incorrect because it involves launching an EC2 instance to monitor the SQS queue, which is not a stateless solution.
Option E is incorrect because it involves using Amazon EventBridge (formerly Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an alert to an Amazon Simple
Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic, which is not related to the image processing process.

A. Create a Network Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
B. Create an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet of the application's VPC to route the traffic to the appliance for packet inspection.
C. Deploy a transit gateway in the inspection VPConfigure route tables to route the incoming packets through the transit gateway.
D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive the incoming 
packets and forward the packets to the appliance.


ans:
D. Deploy a Gateway Load Balancer in the inspection VPC. Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to receive 
the incoming packets and forward the packets to the appliance.

A Gateway Load Balancer can inspect traffic before forwarding it to a virtual appliance for additional processing. 
The solution will not require changing the existing architecture and will have the least amount of operational overhead.
The appliance can be configured with a specific IP interface to accept IP packets. The Gateway Load Balancer can be configured
with an endpoint to route incoming packets to the appliance. The solution ensures all traffic to the web application is inspected before it reaches the web server.


Keywords:Third-party virtual firewall appliance from AWS Marketplace in an inspection VPC -> only Gateway Load Balancer support it

A: Incorrect - Network Load Balancer don't support to route traffic to third-party virtual firewall appliance.
B: Incorrect - Application Load Balancer don't support to route traffic to third-party virtual firewall appliance.
C: Incorrect - Transit Gateway is use as connect center to connect all VPC, Direct Connect Gateway and VPN Connection. Routes Tables 
in Trasit Gateway only limit which VPC can talk to other VPCs.
D: Correct - Gateway Load Balancer support route traffic to third-party virtual firewall appliance in layer 3 that make it different from ALB and NLB.

20. A company wants to improve its ability to clone large amounts of production data into a test environment in the same AWS Region. The data is 
stored in Amazon EC2 instances on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes. Modifications to the cloned data must not 
affect the production environment. The software that accesses this data requires consistently high I/O performance.
A solutions architect needs to minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Restore the snapshots onto EC2 instance store volumes in the test environment.
B. Configure the production EBS volumes to use the EBS Multi-Attach feature. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. 
Attach the production EBS volumes to the EC2 instances in the test environment.
C. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Create and initialize new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 
instances in the test environment before restoring the volumes from the production EBS snapshots.
D. Take EBS snapshots of the production EBS volumes. Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots. 
Restore the snapshots into new EBS volumes. Attach the new EBS volumes to EC2 instances in the test environment.


ans: 
Keywords:
- Modifications to the cloned data must not affect the production environment.
- Minimize the time that is required to clone the production data into the test environment.

A: Incorrect - we can do this But it is not minimize the time as requirement.
B: Incorrect - This approach use same EBS volumes for produciton and test. If we modify test then it
will be affected prodution environment.
C: Incorrect - EBS snapshot will create new EBS volumes. It can not restore from existing volumes.
D: Correct - Turn on the EBS fast snapshot restore feature on the EBS snapshots -> no latency on first use

21. An ecommerce company wants to launch a one-deal-a-day website on AWS. Each day will feature exactly one product on sale for a period of 24 hours. 
The company wants to be able to handle millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency during peak hours.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use Amazon S3 to host the full website in different S3 buckets. Add Amazon CloudFront distributions. Set the S3 buckets as origins 
for the distributions. Store the order data in Amazon S3.
B. Deploy the full website on Amazon EC2 instances that run in Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones. Add an Application
Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute the website traffic. Add another ALB for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.
C. Migrate the full application to run in containers. Host the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use the
Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to increase and decrease the number of pods to process bursts in traffic. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.
D. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. 
Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.


ans: DynamoDB is only suitable because of its really fast milliseconds speed.
the solution that will meet these requirements with the least operational overhead is D: Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's 
static content, deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution, set the S3 bucket as the origin, and use Amazon API Gateway and AWS 
Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

Using Amazon S3 to host static content and Amazon CloudFront to distribute the content can provide high performance and scale for websites with millions of 
requests each hour. Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda can be used to build scalable and highly available backend APIs to support the website, and Amazon
DynamoDB can be used to store the data. This solution requires minimal operational overhead as it leverages fully managed services that automatically scale to meet demand.

Option A is incorrect because using multiple S3 buckets to host the full website would not provide the required performance and 
scale for millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency.
Option B is incorrect because deploying the full website on EC2 instances and using an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an RDS
database would require more operational overhead to maintain and scale the infrastructure.
Option C is incorrect because while deploying the application in containers and hosting them on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes 
Service (EKS) can provide high performance and scale, it would require more operational overhead to maintain and scale the
infrastructure compared to using fully managed services like S3 and CloudFront.

22. A solutions architect is using Amazon S3 to design the storage architecture of a new digital media application. The media files must be 
resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone. Some files are accessed frequently while other files are rarely accessed in an unpredictable pattern. 
The solutions architect must minimize the costs of storing and retrieving the media files.
Which storage option meets these requirements?

A. S3 Standard
B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
C. S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)
D. S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)


ans:
The storage option that meets these requirements is B: S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
Amazon S3 Intelligent Tiering is a storage class that automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based 
on access patterns. It can store objects in two access tiers: the frequent access tier and the infrequent access tier. The frequent
access tier is optimized for frequently accessed objects and is charged at the same rate as S3 Standard. The infrequent access tier is
optimized for objects that are not accessed frequently and are charged at a lower rate than S3 Standard.

S3 Intelligent Tiering is a good choice for storing media files that are accessed frequently and infrequently in an unpredictable 
pattern because it automatically moves data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on access patterns, minimizing storage and 
retrieval costs. It is also resilient to the loss of an Availability Zone because it stores objects in multiple Availability Zones within a region.

23. A company observes an increase in Amazon EC2 costs in its most recent bill. The billing team notices unwanted vertical scaling of instance 
types for a couple of EC2 instances. A solutions architect needs to create a graph comparing the last 2 months of EC2 costs and perform an
in-depth analysis to identify the root cause of the vertical scaling.
How should the solutions architect generate the information with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use AWS Budgets to create a budget report and compare EC2 costs based on instance types.
B. Use Cost Explorer's granular filtering feature to perform an in-depth analysis of EC2 costs based on instance types.
C. Use graphs from the AWS Billing and Cost Management dashboard to compare EC2 costs based on instance types for the last 2 months.
D. Use AWS Cost and Usage Reports to create a report and send it to an Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon QuickSight with Amazon S3 as a source to generate an
interactive graph based on instance types.


ans:
Cost Explorer, AWS prepares the data about your costs for the current month and the last 12 months, and then calculates the forecast 
for the next 12 months. The current month's data is available for viewing in about 24 hours. The rest of your data takes a few days 
longer. Cost Explorer updates your cost data at least once every 24 hour.

24. A company is storing backup files by using Amazon S3 Standard storage. The files are accessed frequently for 1 month. However,
the files are not accessed after 1 month. The company must keep the files indefinitely.
Which storage solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Configure S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects.
B. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.
C. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month.
D. Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month.


ans:
The storage solution that will meet these requirements most cost-effectively is B: Create an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition objects 
from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month.

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 storage class for long-term retention of data that
is rarely accessed and for which retrieval times of several hours are acceptable. It is the lowest-cost storage option in Amazon S3, making 
it a cost-effective choice for storing backup files that are not accessed after 1 month.
You can use an S3 Lifecycle configuration to automatically transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 month. 
This will minimize the storage costs for the backup files that are not accessed frequently.

Option A, configuring S3 Intelligent-Tiering to automatically migrate objects, is not a good choice because it is not designed
for long-term storage and does not offer the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Option C, transitioning objects from S3 Standard to S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) after 1 month, is not a good 
choice because it is not the lowest-cost storage option and would not provide the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Option D, transitioning objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 month, is not a good 
choice because it is not the lowest-cost storage option and would not provide the cost benefits of S3 Glacier Deep Archive.




Storage Class                      	Examples of Data Stored

25. A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and 
to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database.
During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas significantly to handle the high volumes 
of data that the company needs to load into the database. A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve 
scalability and minimize the configuration effort.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Refactor the Lambda function code to Apache Tomcat code that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Connect the database 
by using native Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers.
B. Change the platform from Aurora to Amazon DynamoDProvision a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Use the DAX client
SDK to point the existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster.
C. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information 
into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).
D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into
the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

Current Flow:
Users send data â†’ API Gateway receives it â†’ Lambda processes it â†’ Data is stored in Aurora.

During the proof-of-concept (PoC) phase, the company realizes that:
High volumes of data are being received.
AWS Lambda quotas (memory, execution time, concurrency limits) are not enough to handle the load.
Direct writes from Lambda to Aurora are inefficient, causing scalability issues (e.g., too many connections to the database).
The company now needs a better design that:
âœ” Improves scalability (handles large amounts of data).
âœ” Minimizes configuration effort (automates as much as possible).

Current Problem:
The single Lambda function is overloaded due to high-volume data ingestion and direct writes to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL.
AWS Lambda has concurrency limits, and too many database connections can slow down Aurora.

New Proposed Solution (Option D)
Lambda Function 1 (Data Receiver)
This function receives data from API Gateway.
Instead of directly inserting data into Aurora, it places the data in an Amazon SQS queue.

Amazon SQS (Buffer Layer)
Stores incoming messages temporarily.
Decouples the receiving process from database writing.
Handles traffic spikes and prevents database overload.

Lambda Function 2 (Data Loader)
Reads messages from Amazon SQS in batches.
Processes and loads the data into Aurora PostgreSQL efficiently.

ans:
It could be C or D, but Ans D wins because
â€“SNS is Push Mechanism - â€˜Other Lambdaâ€™ function is forced to take message when it might not be ready (or refuse it)
â€“SQS is Pull Mechanism â€“ â€˜Other Lambdaâ€™ function can take next message when its ready to do so
SQS is simple and allows better de-coupling.

26. A company needs to review its AWS Cloud deployment to ensure that its Amazon S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.
B. Turn on AWS Trusted Advisor with the appropriate checks.
C. Turn on Amazon Inspector with the appropriate assessment template.
D. Turn on Amazon S3 server access logging. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon Cloud Watch Events).


sol: The solution that will accomplish this goal is A: Turn on AWS Config with the appropriate rules.
AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources.
You can use AWS Config to monitor and record changes to the configuration of your Amazon S3 buckets. By turning on
AWS Config and enabling the appropriate rules, you can ensure that your S3 buckets do not have unauthorized configuration changes.
   
AWS Trusted Advisor (Option B) is a service that provides best practice recommendations for your AWS resources, but it does not 
monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 buckets.
Amazon Inspector (Option C) is a service that helps you assess the security and compliance of your applications. While it 
can be used to assess the security of your S3 buckets, it does not monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 buckets.
Amazon S3 server access logging (Option D) enables you to log requests made to your S3 bucket. While it can help you identify changes to your S3 bucket,
it does not monitor or record changes to the configuration of your S3 bucket.

27. A company is launching a new application and will display application metrics on an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard. The company's product 
manager needs to access this dashboard periodically. The product manager does not have an AWS account. A solutions architect must provide access 
to the product manager by following the principle of least privilege.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Share the dashboard from the CloudWatch console. Enter the product manager's email address, and complete the sharing steps. Provide a shareable
link for the dashboard to the product manager.
B. Create an IAM user specifically for the product manager. Attach the CloudWatchReadOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the user. Share the new
login credentials with the product manager. Share the browser URL of the correct dashboard with the product manager.
C. Create an IAM user for the company's employees. Attach the ViewOnlyAccess AWS managed policy to the IAM user. Share the new login credentials with 
the product manager. Ask the product manager to navigate to the CloudWatch console and locate the dashboard by name in the Dashboards section.
D. Deploy a bastion server in a public subnet. When the product manager requires access to the dashboard, start the server and share the RDP credentials.
On the bastion server, ensure that the browser is configured to open the dashboard URL with cached AWS credentials that have appropriate permissions to view the dashboard.


sol:
option b has a problem for cloudwatchreadonlyacess policy, itâ€™s not only grant read access to dashboard, but other read permission
for logs, insights, etc. so it does not follows the principle of least privilege. Option A only grants access to dashboard.
ans is a, Share a single dashboard and designate specific email addresses of the people who can view the dashboard. Each of these users creates 
their own password that they must enter to view the dashboard.

28. A company is migrating applications to AWS. The applications are deployed in different accounts. The company manages the accounts
centrally by using AWS Organizations. The company's security team needs a single sign-on (SSO) solution across all the company's accounts.
The company must continue managing the users and groups in its on-premises self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console. Create a one-way forest trust or a one-way domain trust to connect the 
company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory with AWS SSO by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
B. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console. Create a two-way forest trust to connect the company's self-managed Microsoft
Active Directory with AWS SSO by using AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory.
C. Use AWS Directory Service. Create a two-way trust relationship with the company's self-managed Microsoft Active Directory.
D. Deploy an identity provider (IdP) on premises. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) from the AWS SSO console.



sol: Tricky question!!! forget one-way or two-way. In this scenario, AWS applications (Amazon Chime, Amazon Connect, Amazon QuickSight, 
AWS Single Sign-On, Amazon WorkDocs, Amazon WorkMail, Amazon WorkSpaces, AWS Client VPN, AWS Management Console, and AWS Transfer Family) need to 
be able to look up objects from the on-premises domain in order for them to function. This tells you that authentication needs to
flow both ways. This scenario requires a two-way trust between the on-premises and AWS Managed Microsoft AD domains.
It is a requirement of the application
Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, and Amazon FSx will work with either a one-way or two-way trust.

AWS IAM Identity Center requires a two-way trust so that it has permissions to read user and group information from your domain 
to synchronize user and group metadata. IAM Identity Center uses this metadata when assigning access to permission sets or applications. 
User and group metadata is also used by applications for collaboration, like when you share a dashboard with another user or group. 
The trust from AWS Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory to your domain permits IAM Identity Center to trust your domain for authentication.
The trust in the opposite direction grants AWS permissions to read user and group metadata.

29. A company provides a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service that uses UDP connections. The service consists of Amazon EC2 instances 
that run in an Auto Scaling group. The company has deployments across multiple AWS Regions.
The company needs to route users to the Region with the lowest latency. The company also needs automated failover between Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group.
Use the NLB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
B. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling 
group. Use the ALB as an AWS Global Accelerator endpoint in each Region.
C. Deploy a Network Load Balancer (NLB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. 
Create an Amazon Route 53 latency record that points to aliases for each NLB. Create an Amazon CloudFront 
distribution that uses the latency record as an origin.
D. Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and an associated target group. Associate the target group with the Auto Scaling group. 
Create an Amazon Route 53 weighted record that points to aliases for each ALB. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront 
distribution that uses the weighted record as an origin.


sol: A - Global Accelerator is a good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as
well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional failover.
Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
CloudFront uses Edge Locations to cache content while Global Accelerator uses Edge Locations to find an optimal pathway to the
nearest regional endpoint. CloudFront is designed to handle HTTP protocol meanwhile Global Accelerator is best used for both HTTP
and non-HTTP protocols such as TCP and UDP. so i think A is a better answer

30. A development team runs monthly resource-intensive tests on its general purpose Amazon RDS for MySQL DB instance with Performance Insights enabled. 
The testing lasts for 48 hours once a month and is the only process that uses the database. The team wants to reduce the cost of 
running the tests without reducing the compute and memory attributes of the DB instance.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Stop the DB instance when tests are completed. Restart the DB instance when required.
B. Use an Auto Scaling policy with the DB instance to automatically scale when tests are completed.
C. Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.
D. Modify the DB instance to a low-capacity instance when tests are completed. Modify the DB instance again when required.


real world ex: Imagine a software testing company that runs load tests on a MySQL database once a month to:
Simulate high user traffic on a new application.
Analyze database performance under stress.
Ensure the application can handle peak loads.

and ðŸ”¹ Without a snapshot? They would lose all database configurations and data, forcing them to manually recreate the database each time, which is inefficient.



sol: The correct answer is: C. Create a snapshot when tests are completed. Terminate the DB instance and restore the snapshot when required.
Explanation:
This solution is the most cost-effective because it allows the development team to:
Save Costs by Terminating the Instance:
When the DB instance is not in use (28 out of 30 days), terminating it eliminates the costs associated with running a live instance.
You only pay for storage costs associated with the snapshot, which is significantly lower than the cost of keeping a running instance.

Restoring a Snapshot:
Restoring from a snapshot is straightforward and brings the database back with the same data and configuration as before.
Itâ€™s a good practice when dealing with periodic, resource-intensive tasks like the monthly tests.

31. A company that hosts its web application on AWS wants to ensure all Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon RDS DB instances. and Amazon Redshift clusters
are configured with tags. The company wants to minimize the effort of configuring and operating this check.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this?

A. Use AWS Config rules to define and detect resources that are not properly tagged. Most Voted
B. Use Cost Explorer to display resources that are not properly tagged. Tag those resources manually.
C. Write API calls to check all resources for proper tag allocation. Periodically run the code on an EC2 instance.
D. Write API calls to check all resources for proper tag allocation. Schedule an AWS Lambda function through Amazon CloudWatch to periodically run the code.



ans: Yes, you can use AWS Config to create tags for your resources. AWS Config is a service that enables you to assess,
audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. You can use AWS Config to create rules that automatically tag
resources when they are created or when their configurations change.

To create tags for your resources using AWS Config, you will need to create an AWS Config rule that specifies the tag key 
and value you want to use and the resources you want to apply the tag to. You can then enable the rule and AWS Config will
automatically apply the tag to the specified resources when they are created or when their configurations change.

Option B (using Cost Explorer) primarily focuses on cost analysis and does not provide direct enforcement of proper tagging. 
Option C and D (writing API calls and running them manually or through scheduled Lambda) require more manual effort and
maintenance compared to using AWS Config rules.

32. A development team needs to host a website that will be accessed by other teams. The website contents consist of HTML, CSS, client-side JavaScript, and images.
Which method is the MOST cost-effective for hosting the website?

A. Containerize the website and host it in AWS Fargate.
B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket and host the website there.
C. Deploy a web server on an Amazon EC2 instance to host the website.
D. Configure an Application Load Balancer with an AWS Lambda target that uses the Express.js framework.


ans:
Good answer is B: client-side JavaScript. the website is static, so it must be S3.

I had initially thought Ans A... but its Ans C -- "cookieMr" makes it clear:
Ans A "Containerising the website and hosting with AWS Fargate involves additional complexity and costs associated with managing 
the container environment and scaling resources."
So it has to be...
Ans B: "...Amazon S3 to host the website, take advantage of its durability, scalability, and low-cost pricing model. Only pay
for the storage and data transfer associated with your website, without the need for managing and maintaining web servers or containers.
This reduces the operational overhead and infrastructure costs."

33. A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. 
The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of financial transactions with several other
internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval.
What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

A. Store the transactions data into Amazon DynamoDB. Set up a rule in DynamoDB to remove sensitive data from every transaction 
upon write. Use DynamoDB Streams to share the transactions data with other applications.
B. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to store data in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3. Use AWS Lambda
integration with Kinesis Data Firehose to remove sensitive data. Other applications can consume the data stored in Amazon S3.
C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every 
transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can 
consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.
D. Store the batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files. Use AWS Lambda to process every file and remove sensitive
data before updating the files in Amazon S3. The Lambda function then stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB.
Other applications can consume transaction files stored in Amazon S3.

ans: I would go for C. The tricky phrase is "near-real-time solution", pointing to Firehouse, 
but it can't send data to DynamoDB, so it leaves us with C as best option.

Kinesis Data Firehose currently supports Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Amazon OpenSearch Service, 
Splunk, Datadog, NewRelic, Dynatrace, Sumologic, LogicMonitor, MongoDB, and HTTP End Point as destinations.

(((((Stream is used if you want real time results , but with firehose , you generally use the data at a later point of time by storing it 
somewhere. Hence if you see "REAL TIME" the answer is most probably Kinesis Data Streams.)))))

What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and AWS Config to record API calls.
B. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and AWS CloudTrail to record API calls.
C. Use AWS Config to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls.
D. Use AWS CloudTrail to track configuration changes and Amazon CloudWatch to record API calls.


ans: CloudTrail - Track user activity and API call history.
Config - Assess, audits, and evaluates the configuration and relationships of tag resources.

Therefore, the answer is B

instances within a VPC behind an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB). A third-party service is used for the DNS. The company's solutions 
architect must recommend a solution to detect and protect against large-scale DDoS attacks.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Enable Amazon GuardDuty on the account.
B. Enable Amazon Inspector on the EC2 instances.
C. Enable AWS Shield and assign Amazon Route 53 to it.
D. Enable AWS Shield Advanced and assign the ELB to it.

ans: AWS Shield Advanced provides expanded DDoS attack protection for your Amazon EC2 instances, Elastic Load Balancing load balancers,
CloudFront distributions, Route 53 hosted zones, and AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerators.
The solution also offers a direct response mechanism (via the AWS DDoS Response Team) for further assistance during attacks.


A: GuardDuty is not for this, mostly for account monitoring for suspicious activity
B: Inspector is for OS vulnerabilities
C: Shield with R53 is not going to protect against DDoS
D: Shield Advanced is build for DDoS protection

36. A company is building an application in the AWS Cloud. The application will store data in Amazon S3 buckets in two AWS Regions. 
The company must use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt all data that is stored in the S3 buckets. 
The data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key. The data and the key must be stored in each of the two Regions.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed
encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between
the S3 buckets. Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.
C. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption 
with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
D. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS
KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.

ans:
B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between the S3 buckets.
Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.

Explanation:
The requirement is to use the same KMS key in both AWS Regions.
AWS multi-Region KMS keys allow encryption and decryption across multiple Regions using the same key.
Client-side encryption ensures that the application encrypts the data before storing it in S3, so the same KMS key can be used across both Regions.
Replication is necessary to keep data synchronized between the two S3 buckets.

Why not the other options?
A: Uses Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3), but the requirement is to use a customer managed KMS key.
C: Uses a customer managed KMS key but does not support using the same key across Regions.
D: Uses SSE-KMS, but each Region will have a different KMS key because single-Region KMS keys cannot be used across Regions.

37. A company recently launched a variety of new workloads on Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. The company needs to create a 
strategy to access and administer the instances remotely and securely. The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works
with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Use the EC2 serial console to directly access the terminal interface of each instance for administration.
B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to
establish a remote SSH session. Most Voted
C. Create an administrative SSH key pair. Load the public key into each EC2 instance. Deploy a bastion host in a public 
subnet to provide a tunnel for administration of each instance.
D. Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Instruct administrators to use their local on-premises machines to connect
directly to the instances by using SSH keys across the VPN tunnel.



ans:
Option A provides direct access to the terminal interface of each instance, but it may not be practical for administration 
purposes and can be cumbersome to manage, especially for multiple instances.

Option C adds operational overhead and introduces additional infrastructure that needs to be managed, monitored,
and secured. It also requires SSH key management and maintenance.

Option D is complex and may not be necessary for remote administration. It also requires administrators to connect from 
their local on-premises machines, which adds complexity and potential security risks.

Therefore, option B is the recommended solution as it provides secure, auditable, and repeatable remote access using IAM roles and AWS Systems
Manager Session Manager, with minimal operational overhead.

38. A company is hosting a static website on Amazon S3 and is using Amazon Route 53 for DNS. The website is experiencing increased 
demand from around the world. The company must decrease latency for users who access the website.
Which solution meets these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Replicate the S3 bucket that contains the website to all AWS Regions. Add Route 53 geolocation routing entries.
B. Provision accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator. Associate the supplied IP addresses with the S3 bucket. Edit the Route
53 entries to point to the IP addresses of the accelerators.
C. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the S3 bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the CloudFront distribution. Most Voted
D. Enable S3 Transfer Acceleration on the bucket. Edit the Route 53 entries to point to the new endpoint.


ans: 
Keywords:
Global, Reduce latency, S3, Static Website, Cost effective = Amazon CloudFront

Option A (replicating the S3 bucket to all AWS Regions) can be costly and complex, requiring replication of data 
across multiple Regions and managing synchronization. It may not provide a significant latency 
improvement compared to the CloudFront solution.

Option B (provisioning accelerators in AWS Global Accelerator) can be more expensive as it adds
an extra layer of infrastructure (accelerators) and requires associating IP addresses with the S3 bucket. 
CloudFront already includes global edge locations and provides similar acceleration capabilities.

Option D (enabling S3 Transfer Acceleration) can help improve upload speed to the S3 bucket but may not
have a significant impact on reducing latency for website visitors.

Therefore, option C is the most cost-effective solution as it leverages CloudFront's caching and global
distribution capabilities to decrease latency and improve website performance.

39. A company maintains a searchable repository of items on its website. The data is stored in an Amazon RDS for MySQL database table
that contains more than 10 million rows. The database has 2 TB of General Purpose SSD storage. There are millions of updates against
this data every day through the company's website.
The company has noticed that some insert operations are taking 10 seconds or longer. The company has determined that the database storage performance is the problem.
Which solution addresses this performance issue?

A. Change the storage type to Provisioned IOPS SSD.
B. Change the DB instance to a memory optimized instance class.
C. Change the DB instance to a burstable performance instance class.
D. Enable Multi-AZ RDS read replicas with MySQL native asynchronous replication.


ans:
A: Made for high levels of I/O opps for consistent, predictable performance.
B: Can improve performance of insert opps, but it's a storage performance rather than processing power problem
C: for moderate CPU usage
D: for scale read-only replicas and doesn't improve performance of insert opps on the primary DB instance

40. A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert
is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis.
The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want 
to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days.
What is the MOST operationally efficient solution that meets these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose 
stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration 
to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days. Most Voted
B. Launch Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer to ingest the alerts. 
Create a script on the EC2 instances that will store the alerts in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle 
configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.
C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose 
stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster. Set up the Amazon 
OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to take manual snapshots every day
and delete data from the cluster that is older than 14 days.
D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to ingest the alerts, and set the message 
retention period to 14 days. Configure consumers to poll the SQS queue, check the age of the message, and analyze 
the message data as needed. If the message is 14 days old, the consumer should copy the message to
an Amazon S3 bucket and delete the message from the SQS queue.


ans:
B suggests launching EC2 instances to ingest and store the alerts, which introduces additional infrastructure
management overhead and may not be as cost-effective and scalable as using 
managed services like Kinesis Data Firehose and S3.
C involves delivering the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service cluster and manually managing snapshots and data deletion. This introduces
additional complexity and manual overhead compared to the simpler solution of using Kinesis Data Firehose and S3.
D suggests using SQS to ingest the alerts, but it does not provide the same level of data persistence and durability as storing 
the alerts directly in S3. Additionally, it requires manual processing and 
copying of messages to S3, which adds operational complexity.

Therefore, A provides the most operationally efficient solution that meets the company's requirements by leveraging Kinesis Data 
Firehose to ingest the alerts, storing them in an S3 bucket, and using an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to S3 
Glacier for long-term archival, all without the need for managing additional infrastructure.
Only A makes sense operationally, as Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that can capture, transform, and deliver
streaming data into storage systems or analytics tools, making it an ideal solution for ingesting and 
storing status alerts. In this solution, the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream ingests the alerts 
and delivers them to an S3 bucket, which is a cost-effective storage solution. An S3 Lifecycle configuration 
is set up to transition the data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days to minimize storage costs.

If you think D, just consider what is needed to move the message from SQS to S3... you are polling daily 14 TB to take out 1 TB...
that's no operationally efficient at all.
"A" is simply correct because kinesis firehouse is made for this, SQS standard is not going to support 500 million alerts 2KB each (1 TB) this service is made for requests that are lighter.

41. A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection. The company runs
Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis. The same EC2 instance that
receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete. The company has noticed slow
application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible.
Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

A. Create an Auto Scaling group so that EC2 instances can scale out. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon
Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to
send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for each SaaS source to send output data. Configure the S3 bucket as
the rule's target. Create a second EventBridge (Cloud Watch Events) rule to send events when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.
Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the second rule's target.
D. Create a Docker container to use instead of an EC2 instance. Host the containerized application on Amazon Elastic Container Service 
(Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when 
the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

sol: AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that helps you securely transfer data between software as a service (SaaS) 
applications such as Salesforce, SAP, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and ServiceNow, and AWS services such as Amazon 
Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Redshift in just a "few clicks". remember the question is asking 
for "the LEAST operational overhead", While Auto Scaling improves performance, it still involves managing EC2 instances, 
which adds operational overhead compared to a managed service like AppFlow.

42. A company runs a highly available image-processing application on Amazon EC2 instances in a single VPC. The EC2 instances run inside
several subnets across multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances do not communicate with each other. However, the EC2 instances download 
images from Amazon S3 and upload images to Amazon S3 through a single NAT gateway. The company is concerned about data transfer charges.
What is the MOST cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer charges?

A. Launch the NAT gateway in each Availability Zone.
B. Replace the NAT gateway with a NAT instance.
C. Deploy a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3.
D. Provision an EC2 Dedicated Host to run the EC2 instances.

ans: C
Deploying a gateway VPC endpoint for Amazon S3 is the most cost-effective way for the company to avoid Regional data transfer 
charges. A gateway VPC endpoint is a network gateway that allows communication between instances in a VPC and
a service, such as Amazon S3, without requiring an Internet gateway or a NAT device. Data transfer between the VPC 
and the service through a gateway VPC endpoint is free of charge, while data transfer between the VPC and the Internet 
through an Internet gateway or NAT device is subject to data transfer charges. By using a gateway VPC endpoint, the 
company can reduce its data transfer costs by eliminating the need to transfer data through the NAT gateway to access Amazon S3.
This option would provide the required connectivity to Amazon S3 and minimize data transfer charges.

43. A company has an on-premises application that generates a large amount of time-sensitive data that is backed up to Amazon S3.
The application has grown and there are user complaints about internet bandwidth limitations. A solutions architect needs to design 
a long-term solution that allows for both timely backups to Amazon S3 and with minimal impact on internet connectivity for internal users.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Establish AWS VPN connections and proxy all traffic through a VPC gateway endpoint.
B. Establish a new AWS Direct Connect connection and direct backup traffic through this new connection.
C. Order daily AWS Snowball devices. Load the data onto the Snowball devices and return the devices to AWS each day.
D. Submit a support ticket through the AWS Management Console. Request the removal of S3 service limits from the account.
 
ans:
AWS Direct Connect is a network service that allows you to establish a dedicated network connection from your
on-premises data center to AWS. This connection bypasses the public Internet and can provide more reliable, lower-latency communication 
between your on-premises application and Amazon S3. By directing backup traffic through the AWS Direct Connect connection, 
you can minimize the impact on your internet bandwidth and ensure timely backups to S3.

A: VPN also goes through the internet and uses the bandwidth
C: daily Snowball transfer is not really a long-term solution when it comes to cost and efficiency
D: S3 limits don't change anything here

44. A company has an Amazon S3 bucket that contains critical data. The company must protect the data from accidental deletion.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
B. Enable MFA Delete on the S3 bucket.
C. Create a bucket policy on the S3 bucket.
D. Enable default encryption on the S3 bucket.
E. Create a lifecycle policy for the objects in the S3 bucket.

ans: A B

Enabling versioning on S3 ensures multiple versions of object are stored in bucket. When object is updated
or deleted, new version is created, preserving previous version.

Enabling MFA Delete adds additional layer of protection by requiring MFA device to be present when attempting 
to delete objects. This helps prevent accidental or unauthorized deletions by requiring extra level of authentication.

C. Creating a bucket policy on S3 is more focused on defining access control and permissions for bucket 
and its objects, rather than protecting against accidental deletion.

D. Enabling default encryption on S3 ensures that any new objects uploaded to bucket are automatically 
encrypted. While encryption is important for data security, it does not directly address accidental deletion.

E. Creating lifecycle policy for objects in S3 allows for automated management of objects based on predefined
rules. While this can help with data retention and storage cost optimization, it does not directly protect against accidental deletion.

45. A company has a data ingestion workflow that consists of the following:
â€¢ An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notifications about new data deliveries
â€¢ An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata
The company observes that the ingestion workflow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure 
occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job.
Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)

A. Deploy the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones.
B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.
C. Increase the CPU and memory that are allocated to the Lambda function.
D. Increase provisioned throughput for the Lambda function.
E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

ans: b and e 
B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic:
By adding an SQS queue between the SNS topic and the Lambda function, you decouple the notification and processing layers.
Messages are stored reliably in the SQS queue, and they are not lost even if the Lambda function fails 
temporarily due to network connectivity or other issues.

E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue:
Configuring the Lambda function to poll the SQS queue ensures that messages are processed asynchronously. If a processing 
failure occurs, the message remains in the queue and can be retried without manual intervention.
This ensures all data is eventually processed.

46. A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by
store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to 
generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size.
Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identifiable information (PII)
that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

A. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects 
contain PII, trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the objects that contain PII.
B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain 
PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.
C. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket.
If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators 
to remove the objects that contain PII.
D. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket.
If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to trigger a notification to the administrators and trigger
an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the meats that contain PII.

ans: Amazon Macie is a data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning (ML) and pattern matching to discover and protect your sensitive data

The Key words are PII, 200 GB, and automate remediation
A) Amazon Inspector is about software & network vulnerability detection
B) Amazon Macie is for PII detection, but it has severe quota limitations, i.e. it will only retrieve and analyze a 25MB
JSON file or 100MB text file (wonder if people save JSON as text to analyze bigger files)
Also it's not automatically remediating the problem files
C) won't automatically remediate the problem files
D) While more development effort required than using Macie, it will actually (once developed)
analyze and automatically remove the bad file

This is a horrible question, and the real answer would be to break down the data into smaller chunks and use Macie on that

47. A company needs guaranteed Amazon EC2 capacity in three specific Availability Zones in a specific AWS Region for an upcoming event that will last 1 week.
What should the company do to guarantee the EC2 capacity?

A. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed.
B. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed.
C. Purchase Reserved Instances that specify the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.

ans: 
Reserved instances require a fixed one-year or three-year commitment. 

Option D. Create an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region and three Availability Zones needed.
An On-Demand Capacity Reservation is a type of Amazon EC2 reservation that enables you to create and manage reserved
capacity on Amazon EC2. With an On-Demand Capacity Reservation, you can specify the Region and Availability Zones
where you want to reserve capacity, and the number of EC2 instances you want to reserve. This allows you 
to guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones in a specific Region.

***WRONG***
Option A, purchasing Reserved Instances that specify the Region needed, would not guarantee 
capacity in specific Availability Zones.
Option B, creating an On-Demand Capacity Reservation that specifies the Region needed, would 
not guarantee capacity in specific Availability Zones.
Option C, why Reserved Instances aren't the solution here is that you have to commit to either a 1 year or 3 year term, not 1 week.

49. A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, 
but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability
to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year-old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable.
Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

A. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Query the tags to retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. 
Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query 
and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.
C. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Store search metadata for each archive in 
Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year.
Query and retrieve the files by searching for metadata from Amazon S3.
D. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier 
Deep Archive after 1 year. Store search metadata in Amazon RDS. Query the files from Amazon RDS. Retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.


ans:
B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the ideal storage class for data with unknown, changing, or unpredictable access patterns, independent of
object size or retention period. You can use S3 Intelligent-Tiering as the default storage class for virtually any workload, 
especially data lakes, data analytics, new applications, and user-generated content.

50. A company has a production workload that runs on 1,000 Amazon EC2 Linux instances. The workload is powered by third-party software.
The company needs to patch the third-party software on all EC2 instances as quickly as possible to remediate a critical security vulnerability.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an AWS Lambda function to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
B. Configure AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
C. Schedule an AWS Systems Manager maintenance window to apply the patch to all EC2 instances.
D. Use AWS Systems Manager Run Command to run a custom command that applies the patch to all EC2 instances.

ans:

This question is about patching a critical security vulnerability in third-party software on 1,000 EC2 Linux instances as quickly as possible

Patch Manager is optimized for OS-level security patches and may not support the specific third-party software patch required in this scenario.
Even if the third-party software is supported, Patch Manager may not provide the level of control or speed needed for a critical security update.
so, Run Command allows you to automate common administrative tasks and perform one-time configuration changes at scale. (

51. A company is developing an application that provides order shipping statistics for retrieval by a REST API. 
The company wants to extract the shipping statistics, organize the data into an easy-to-read HTML format, and send the
report to several email addresses at the same time every morning.
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

A. Configure the application to send the data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.
B. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.
C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Glue job to query the application's API for the data.
D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.
E. Store the application data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as an S3 event destination to send the report by email.

ans: B D
D Explanation: EventBridge can be used to schedule regular invocations of a Lambda function that retrieves
the required data from the application's API. This step sets up the process to collect 
the data at the specified time every morning.
B Explanation: Amazon SES can format the data into an easy-to-read HTML report and
send the email to multiple recipients efficiently.

A. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose: This service is typically used for real-time streaming data processing
rather than for scheduled tasks like generating a morning report.
C. Amazon EventBridge to invoke an AWS Glue job: AWS Glue is a data integration service that's more focused on ETL 
(extract, transform, load) operations, often involving large datasets and complex transformations, which might be more than needed for this scenario.
E. Amazon S3 with SNS topic: Storing data in S3 and using SNS for notification is viable, but this doesn't directly
address the need to format the data into HTML and send it as an email report. SNS is better suited for sending notifications rather than formatted reports.

52. A company wants to migrate its on-premises application to AWS. The application produces output files that vary in size from tens
of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. The application data must be stored in a standard file system structure. The company wants a solution that 
scales automatically. is highly available, and requires minimum operational overhead.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Use Amazon S3 for storage.
B. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.
C. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storage.
D. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.

ans: C
EFS as It is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files.
Multiple compute instances, including Amazon EC2, Amazon ECS, and AWS Lambda,
can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, providing a common data source
for workloads.

archived for an additional 9 years. No one at the company, including administrative users and root users, can be able to delete the records 
during the entire 10-year period. The records must be stored with maximum resiliency.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Store the records in S3 Glacier for the entire 10-year period. Use an access control policy to deny deletion
of the records for a period of 10 years.
B. Store the records by using S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use an IAM policy to deny deletion of the records. After 10 years,
change the IAM policy to allow deletion.
C. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Use S3 Object 
Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years.
D. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 year.
Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode for a period of 10 years.

ans: C

Only CD provides Object Lock options which is required for stopping admin/root users from deleting.
D is governance mode which is like government, pay enough money and you can do anything. This is not what we want so compliance is the option.
C is right choice.

54. A company runs multiple Windows workloads on AWS. The company's employees use Windows file shares that are hosted
on two Amazon EC2 instances. The file shares synchronize data between themselves and maintain duplicate copies. 
The company wants a highly available and durable storage solution that preserves how users currently access the files.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Migrate all the data to Amazon S3. Set up IAM authentication for users to access files.
B. Set up an Amazon S3 File Gateway. Mount the S3 File Gateway on the existing EC2 instances.
C. Extend the file share environment to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate 
all the data to FSx for Windows File Server.
D. Extend the file share environment to Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with a Multi-AZ configuration. Migrate
all the data to Amazon EFS.

ans: c

Migrating all the data to FSx for Windows File Server allows you to preserve existing user access method and maintain
compatibility with Windows file shares. Users can continue accessing files using the same method as before, without any disruptions.

A: S3 is a highly durable object storage service, it is not designed to directly host Windows file shares. Implementing
IAM authentication for file access would require significant changes to existing user access method.

B: S3 File Gateway can provide access to Amazon S3 objects through standard file protocols, it may not be ideal
solution for preserving existing user access method and maintaining Windows file shares.

D: Although Amazon EFS provides highly available and durable file storage, it may not directly support
the existing Windows file shares and their access method.

55. A solutions architect is developing a VPC architecture that includes multiple subnets. The architecture will host
applications that use Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances. The architecture consists of six subnets in 
two Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone includes a public subnet, a private subnet, and a dedicated subnet for databases.
Only EC2 instances that run in the private subnets can have access to the RDS databases.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create a new route table that excludes the route to the public subnets' CIDR blocks. Associate the 
route table with the database subnets.
B. Create a security group that denies inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances
in the public subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.
C. Create a security group that allows inbound traffic from the security group that is assigned to instances in
the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.
D. Create a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets. Create a different peering 
connection between the private subnets and the database subnets.

Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain
name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
B. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the
Regional API Gateway stage endpoint.
Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain 
name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.
C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import 
the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the same Region.
Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure
Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint.
D. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the 
public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. 
Attach the certificate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name.
Point an A record to the company's domain name.


ans:

Option C includes all the necessary steps to meet the requirements, hence it is the correct solution.

Options A and D do not include the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway 
endpoint with the company's domain name and attach the certificate to the endpoint.

Option B includes the necessary steps to associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name
and attach the certificate, but it imports the certificate into the us-east-1 Region
instead of the ca-central-1 Region where the API Gateway is located.

To design the API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certificate, the company needs to do the following:
1. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to create an endpoint that is specific to a region.
2. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name: This will allow the company to use
its own domain name for the API Gateway URL.
3. Import the public certificate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in the 
same Region: This will allow the company to use HTTPS for secure communication with its APIs.
4. Attach the certificate to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use the certificate
for securing the API Gateway URL.
5. Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the API Gateway endpoint: This will allow the company to use Route 53 to route traffic
to the API Gateway URL using the company's domain name.

57. A company is running a popular social media website. The website gives users the ability to upload images to share with
other users. The company wants to make sure that the images do not contain inappropriate content. 
The company needs a solution that minimizes development effort.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon Comprehend to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
B. Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content. Use human review for low-confidence predictions.
C. Use Amazon SageMaker to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.
D. Use AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model to detect inappropriate content. Use ground truth to label low-confidence predictions.

ans: B
The best solution to meet these requirements would be option B: Use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content, 
and use human review for low-confidence predictions.

Amazon Rekognition is a cloud-based image and video analysis service that can detect inappropriate content in images 
using its pre-trained label detection model. It can identify a wide range of inappropriate content,
including explicit or suggestive adult content, violent content, and offensive language. The
service provides high accuracy and low latency, making it a good choice for this use case.

Option A, using Amazon Comprehend, is not a good fit for this use case because Amazon Comprehend is 
a natural language processing service that is designed to analyze text, not images.

Option C, using Amazon SageMaker to detect inappropriate content, would require significant development 
effort to build and train a custom machine learning model. It would also require a large dataset of labeled 
images to train the model, which may be time-consuming and expensive to obtain.

Option D, using AWS Fargate to deploy a custom machine learning model, would also require significant development
effort and a large dataset of labeled images. It may not be the most efficient or cost-effective solution for this use case.

In summary, the best solution is to use Amazon Rekognition to detect inappropriate content in images, and use human
review for low-confidence predictions to ensure that all inappropriate content is detected.

58. A company wants to run its critical applications in containers to meet requirements for scalability and availability. 
The company prefers to focus on maintenance of the critical applications. The company does not want to be responsible 
for provisioning and managing the underlying infrastructure that runs the containerized workload.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon EC2 instances, and install Docker on the instances.
B. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on Amazon EC2 worker nodes.
C. Use Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) on AWS Fargate.
D. Use Amazon EC2 instances from an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)-optimized Amazon Machine Image (AMI).

ans: C
Using ECS on Fargate allows you to run containers without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure. Fargate 
abstracts away the underlying EC2 and provides serverless compute for containers.

A. This option would require manual provisioning and management of EC2, as well as installing and configuring Docker 
on those instances. It would introduce additional overhead and responsibilities for maintaining the underlying infrastructure.

B. While this option leverages ECS to manage containers, it still requires provisioning and managing EC2 to serve 
as worker nodes. It adds complexity and maintenance overhead compared to the serverless nature of Fargate.

D. This option still involves managing and provisioning EC2, even though an ECS-optimized AMI simplifies the process
of setting up EC2 for running ECS. It does not provide the level of serverless abstraction and ease of management offered by Fargate.

59. A company hosts more than 300 global websites and applications. The company requires a platform to analyze more than 30 TB of clickstream data each day.
What should a solutions architect do to transmit and process the clickstream data?

A. Design an AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and run an Amazon EMR
cluster with the data to generate analytics.
B. Create an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and send it to an Amazon
S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis.
C. Cache the data to Amazon CloudFront. Store the data in an Amazon S3 bucket. When an object is added
to the S3 bucket. run an AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis.
D. Collect the data from Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the
data to an Amazon S3 data lake. Load the data in Amazon Redshift for analysis.

ans:
Option D is the most appropriate solution for transmitting and processing the clickstream data in this scenario.
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is a highly scalable and durable service that enables real-time processing of streaming 
data at a high volume and high rate. You can use Kinesis Data Streams to collect and process the clickstream data in real-time.

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is a fully managed service that loads streaming data into data stores and analytics tools
You can use Kinesis Data Firehose to transmit the data from Kinesis Data Streams to an Amazon S3 data lake.

Once the data is in the data lake, you can use Amazon Redshift to load the data and perform analysis on it. Amazon 
Redshift is a fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that allows you to quickly and efficiently analyze 
data using SQL and your existing business intelligence tools.

**Kinesis Data Streams can continuously capture and ingest high volumes of clickstream data in real-time. This handles the large 30TB daily data intake.
Kinesis Firehose can automatically load the streaming data into S3. This creates a data lake for further analysis.
Firehose can transform and analyze the data in flight before loading to S3 using Lambda. This enables real-time processing.
The data in S3 can be easily loaded into Amazon Redshift for interactive analysis at scale.
Kinesis auto scales to handle the high data volumes. Minimal effort is needed for infrastructure management.**

Option A, which involves using AWS Data Pipeline to archive the data to an Amazon S3 bucket and running an Amazon
EMR cluster with the data to generate analytics, is not the most appropriate solution 
because it does not involve real-time processing of the data.

Option B, which involves creating an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to process the data and 
sending it to an Amazon S3 data lake for Amazon Redshift to use for analysis, is not the most appropriate solution because 
it does not involve a fully managed service for transmitting the data from the processing layer to the data lake.

Option C, which involves caching the data to Amazon CloudFront, storing the data in an Amazon S3 bucket, and running an
AWS Lambda function to process the data for analysis when an object is added to the S3 bucket, is not the most appropriate
solution because it does not involve a scalable and durable service for collecting and processing the data in real-time.

60. A company has a website hosted on AWS. The website is behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB) that is configured to handle HTTP and HTTPS separately.
The company wants to forward all requests to the website so that the requests will use HTTPS.
What should a solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

A. Update the ALB's network ACL to accept only HTTPS traffic.
B. Create a rule that replaces the HTTP in the URL with HTTPS.
C. Create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
D. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer configured to use Server Name Indication (SNI).

ans: c

A. Network ACLs operate at subnet level and control inbound and outbound traffic. Updating the
network ACL alone will not enforce the redirection of HTTP to HTTPS.
B. This approach would require modifying application code or server configuration to perform URL rewrite. It is
not an optimal solution as it adds complexity and potential maintenance overhead. Moreover, it does not leverage the ALB's 
capabilities for handling HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection.
D. While NLB can handle SSL/TLS termination using SNI for routing requests to different services, replacing th ALB solely to
enforce HTTP-to-HTTPS redirection would be an unnecessary and more complex solution.

Therefore, the recommended approach is to create a listener rule on the ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. By configuring a listener rule, 
you can define a redirect action that automatically directs HTTP requests to their corresponding HTTPS versions.
