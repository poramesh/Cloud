1. A company collects data for temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in cities across multiple continents. The average volume of data that the 
company collects from each site daily is 500 GB. Each site has a high-speed Internet connection.
The company wants to aggregate the data from all these global sites as quickly as possible in a single Amazon S3 bucket. 
The solution must minimize operational complexity.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Turn on S3 Transfer Acceleration on the destination S3 bucket. Use multipart uploads to directly upload site data to the destination S3 bucket.
B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.
C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region
Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.
D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.



A. is correct because S3 Transfer Acceleration is support for high speed transfer in Edge location and you can upload it immediately.
Also with multipart uploads your big file can be uploaded in parallel.
B, C, D. is not minimize operational and fast when compare to answer A

what is transfer accelaration?
Uses CloudFront edge locations to speed up uploads.
Reduces latency by using a geographically closer edge location for uploading.
Best for remote locations far from the S3 bucket.

2. A company needs the ability to analyze the log files of its proprietary application. The logs are stored in JSON format in an Amazon S3 bucket. 
Queries will be simple and will run on-demand. A solutions architect needs to perform the analysis with minimal changes to the existing architecture.
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Use Amazon Redshift to load all the content into one place and run the SQL queries as needed.
B. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to store the logs. Run SQL queries as needed from the Amazon CloudWatch console.
C. Use Amazon Athena directly with Amazon S3 to run the queries as needed. Most Voted
D. Use AWS Glue to catalog the logs. Use a transient Apache Spark cluster on Amazon EMR to run the SQL queries as needed.

C is correct, Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) using
standard SQL. With a few actions in the AWS Management Console, you can point Athena at your data stored in Amazon S3 and begin using standard 
SQL to run ad-hoc queries and get results in seconds.

3. A company uses AWS Organizations to manage multiple AWS accounts for different departments. The management account has an Amazon S3 bucket that
contains project reports. The company wants to limit access to this S3 bucket to only users of accounts within the organization in AWS Organizations.
Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST amount of operational overhead?

A. Add the aws PrincipalOrgID global condition key with a reference to the organization ID to the S3 bucket policy.
B. Create an organizational unit (OU) for each department. Add the aws:PrincipalOrgPaths global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.
C. Use AWS CloudTrail to monitor the CreateAccount, InviteAccountToOrganization, LeaveOrganization, and RemoveAccountFromOrganization events. Update the S3 bucket policy accordingly.
D. Tag each user that needs access to the S3 bucket. Add the aws:PrincipalTag global condition key to the S3 bucket policy.



aws:PrincipalOrgID Validates if the principal accessing the resource belongs to an account in your organization.

4. An application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. The application processes logs that are stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. The EC2 instance needs 
to access the S3 bucket without connectivity to the internet.
Which solution will provide private network connectivity to Amazon S3?

A. Create a gateway VPC endpoint to the S3 bucket.
B. Stream the logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs. Export the logs to the S3 bucket.
C. Create an instance profile on Amazon EC2 to allow S3 access.
D. Create an Amazon API Gateway API with a private link to access the S3 endpoint.


answer is A 
If accessing S3/DynamoDB privately: Use a Gateway VPC Endpoint.
If accessing any other AWS service privately: Use an Interface Endpoint (via PrivateLink).
If accessing third-party SaaS applications or services in another account/VPC: Use PrivateLink


((((((
There are two main types of VPC Endpoints:
Gateway Endpoint
Works only for Amazon S3 and DynamoDB.
Uses route tables to direct traffic.
Free to use (no data transfer costs).

Interface Endpoint
Works for most AWS services (e.g., SSM, Secrets Manager, EC2 API, Lambda, etc.).
Uses AWS PrivateLink (creates an elastic network interface inside the VPC).
Not free â€“ incurs per-hour and data processing charges.

5. A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. 
For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, 
placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they 
could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time.
What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?

A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents
B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents
C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS
D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server



Ebs doesnt support cross az only reside in one Az but Efs does, that why it's c

here we start off by copying the current data from ebs to efs and now we modify it to save directly in the amaozn efs.

6. A company uses NFS to store large video files in on-premises network attached storage. Each video file ranges in size from 1 MB to 500 GB. 
The total storage is 70 TB and is no longer growing. The company decides to migrate the video files to Amazon S3. The company must migrate the video 
files as soon as possible while using the least possible network bandwidth.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Create an S3 bucket. Create an IAM role that has permissions to write to the S3 bucket. Use the AWS CLI to copy
all files locally to the S3 bucket.
B. Create an AWS Snowball Edge job. Receive a Snowball Edge device on premises. Use the Snowball Edge client to transfer data to the device. Return 
the device so that AWS can import the data into Amazon S3.
C. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public service endpoint to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new
NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.
D. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection between the on-premises network and AWS. Deploy an S3 File Gateway on premises. Create a public
virtual interface (VIF) to connect to the S3 File Gateway. Create an S3 bucket. Create a new NFS file share on the S3 File Gateway. Point the new
file share to the S3 bucket. Transfer the data from the existing NFS file share to the S3 File Gateway.

sol:
B. On a Snowball Edge device you can copy files with a speed of up to 100Gbps. 70TB will take around 5600 seconds, so very quickly, less 
than 2 hours. The downside is that it'll take between 4-6 working days to receive the device and then another 2-3 working days to send
it back and for AWS to move the data onto S3 once it reaches them. Total time: 6-9 working days. Bandwidth used: 0.

C. File Gateway uses the Internet, so maximum speed will be at most 1Gbps, so it'll take a minimum of 6.5 days and you use 70TB of Internet bandwidth.

D. You can achieve speeds of up to 10Gbps with Direct Connect. Total time 15.5 hours and you will use 70TB of bandwidth. However, what's
interesting is that the question does not specific what type of bandwidth? Direct Connect does not use your Internet bandwidth, as you will 
have a dedicate peer to peer connectivity between your on-prem and the AWS Cloud, so technically, you're not using your "public" bandwidth.

The requirements are a bit too vague but I think that B is the most appropriate answer, although D might also be correct if the bandwidth usage
refers strictly to your public connectivity.


Capacities and Scales of snowball:
Snowball: 50-80 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowball Edge: 100 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowmobile: Up to 100 petabytes (exabyte scale).
snowcone: less than 8 TN

7. A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages.
The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second.
The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability.
Which solution meets these requirements?

A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.
B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.
C. Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages 
and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages.
D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions.
Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

ans: 
Amazon SNS + SQS provides a scalable and decoupled architecture:
SNS is a publish-subscribe messaging service that allows the ingestion application to broadcast messages to multiple subscribers.
SQS acts as the subscriber to the SNS topic, creating separate message queues for each consumer application. This ensures:
Scalability: Messages are distributed across queues, decoupling the producer and consumers.
Reliability: SQS queues store messages until consumer applications can process them, accommodating sudden spikes in message volume.

8. A company is migrating a distributed application to AWS. The application serves variable workloads. The legacy platform consists of a primary
server that coordinates jobs across multiple compute nodes. The company wants to modernize the application with a solution that maximizes resiliency and scalability.
How should a solutions architect design the architecture to meet these requirements?

A. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances 
that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling to use scheduled scaling.
B. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as a destination for the jobs. Implement the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances 
that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the size of the queue.
C. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure AWS CloudTrail
as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the primary server.
D. Implement the primary server and the compute nodes with Amazon EC2 instances that are managed in an Auto Scaling group. Configure Amazon EventBridge
(Amazon CloudWatch Events) as a destination for the jobs. Configure EC2 Auto Scaling based on the load on the compute nodes.

ans:
1.Amazon SQS for Decoupling:
Amazon SQS provides a fully managed message queue to decouple the primary server from the compute nodes. Jobs are sent to the queue, and
compute nodes process them independently.
This architecture eliminates a single point of failure (the primary server) and increases resilience.

2.Auto Scaling Group for Compute Nodes:
EC2 instances managed in an Auto Scaling group process the jobs in the SQS queue. Auto Scaling dynamically adjusts the number of 
instances based on the queue size, ensuring scalability to handle variable workloads.

3.Scalability Based on Queue Size:
Scaling based on the size of the SQS queue ensures that the system adjusts to workload demands efficiently. When the queue grows,
more instances are launched; when the queue shrinks, instances are terminated.


C, D - incorrect: Primary server should not be in same Auto Scaling group with compute nodes.
ASGs are designed for stateless, replaceable compute nodes (e.g., web servers, worker nodes).
If an instance in an ASG fails or is unhealthy, the ASG automatically terminates and replaces it.
Problem: If the primary server (e.g., a database or stateful service) is in the ASG, it could be unintentionally terminated and replaced, leading to data loss or service disruption.
âœ… Best Practice: The primary server should be a separate dedicated instance or managed service (e.g., Amazon RDS for databases).

Compute nodes (web servers, worker nodes, etc.) are stateless, meaning they process tasks without storing persistent data.
Primary servers (databases, controllers, etc.) are stateful, meaning they maintain critical data and connections.
Problem: If the primary server is in an ASG, it may be terminated and restarted without preserving its state, leading to data corruption.

9. A company is running an SMB file server in its data center. The file server stores large files that are accessed frequently for the first few 
days after the files are created. After 7 days the files are rarely accessed.
The total data size is increasing and is close to the company's total storage capacity. A solutions architect must increase the company's available 
storage space without losing low-latency access to the most recently accessed files. The solutions architect must also provide file lifecycle
management to avoid future storage issues.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS.
B. Create an Amazon S3 File Gateway to extend the company's storage space. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data
to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days. Most Voted
C. Create an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server file system to extend the company's storage space.
D. Install a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3. Create an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the data to S3 
Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 7 days.



ans:
Correct answer is B.
Amazon S3 File Gateway provides a seamless way to connect to the cloud to store application data files and backup images as durable 
objects in Amazon S3 cloud storage. Amazon S3 File Gateway offers SMB or NFS-based access to data in Amazon S3 with local caching.
It can be used for on-premises data-intensive Amazon EC2-based applications that need file protocol access to S3 object storage. 
Lifecycle policies can then transition the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 7 days.

The S3 File Gateway allows you to store and retrieve objects in Amazon S3 using standard file system protocols, such as SMB and NFS.
This would provide additional storage space for the company's data and allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files,
as the data would still be stored on the SMB file server.

Option A, using AWS DataSync to copy data that is older than 7 days from the SMB file server to AWS, would not provide additional storage space
for the company's data and would not allow for low-latency access to the most recently accessed files.

Option C, creating an FSx for Windows File Server file system, would provide additional storage space but would not include file lifecycle management.

Option D, installing a utility on each user's computer to access Amazon S3 and creating an S3 Lifecycle policy, would not 
provide additional storage space on the company's file server.

10. A company is building an ecommerce web application on AWS. The application sends information about new orders to an Amazon API Gateway REST
API to process. The company wants to ensure that orders are processed in the order that they are received.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use an API Gateway integration to publish a message to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the application receives an order. 
Subscribe an AWS Lambda function to the topic to perform processing.
B. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue when the application receives an order.
Configure the SQS FIFO queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.
C. Use an API Gateway authorizer to block any requests while the application processes an order.
D. Use an API Gateway integration to send a message to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue when the application receives an order.
Configure the SQS standard queue to invoke an AWS Lambda function for processing.


ans: 
SQS FIFO as if want to maintain order of messages recieved to order of messages sent. It is like QUEUE data structutre in DSA

11. A company has an application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon Aurora database. The EC2 instances connect to the database
by using user names and passwords that are stored locally in a file. The company wants to minimize the operational overhead of credential management.
What should a solutions architect do to accomplish this goal?

A. Use AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation.
B. Use AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation.
C. Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store objects that are encrypted with an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) encryption key. Migrate the credential 
file to the S3 bucket. Point the application to the S3 bucket.
D. Create an encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for each EC2 instance. Attach the new EBS volume to each EC2 instance. Migrate 
the credential file to the new EBS volume. Point the application to the new EBS volume.



ans:
B is wrong because parameter store does not support auto rotation, unless the customer writes it themselves, A is the answer.

12. A global company hosts its web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The web application has static data and 
dynamic data. The company stores its static data in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to improve performance and reduce latency for the static data and 
dynamic data. The company is using its own domain name registered with Amazon Route 53.
What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

A. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket and the ALB as origins. Configure Route
53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
B. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the 
S3 bucket as an endpoint Configure Route 53 to route traffic to the CloudFront distribution.
C. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the S3 bucket as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has 
the ALB and the CloudFront distribution as endpoints. Create a custom domain name that points to the accelerator DNS name. Use the custom domain name 
as an endpoint for the web application.
D. Create an Amazon CloudFront distribution that has the ALB as an origin. Create an AWS Global Accelerator standard accelerator that has the S3 bucket as an endpoint.
Create two domain names. Point one domain name to the CloudFront DNS name for dynamic content. Point the other domain name to the accelerator DNS 
name for static content. Use the domain names as endpoints for the web application.


ans:
Answer is A
Explanation - AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront
â€¢ They both use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
â€¢ Both services integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection.
CloudFront
â€¢ Improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos)
â€¢ Dynamic content (such as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery)
â€¢ Content is served at the edge
Global Accelerator
â€¢ Improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP
â€¢ Proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions.
â€¢ Good fit for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP
â€¢ Good for HTTP use cases that require static IP addresses
â€¢ Good for HTTP use cases that required deterministic, fast regional failover

14. A company runs an ecommerce application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The instances run in an Amazon 
EC2 Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. The Auto Scaling group scales based on CPU utilization metrics. 
The ecommerce application stores the transaction data in a MySQL 8.0 database that is hosted on a large EC2 instance.
The database's performance degrades quickly as application load increases. The application handles more read requests than write transactions.
The company wants a solution that will automatically scale the database to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality.
B. Use Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment Configure Amazon RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone.
C. Use Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas.
D. Use Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances.


ans: 
C, AURORA is 5x performance improvement over MySQL on RDS and handles more read requests than write,; maintaining high availability = Multi-AZ deployment

Option C, using Amazon Aurora with a Multi-AZ deployment and configuring Aurora Auto Scaling with Aurora Replicas,
would be the best solution to meet the requirements.
Aurora is a fully managed, MySQL-compatible relational database that is designed for high performance and high availability. 
Aurora Multi-AZ deployments automatically maintain a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone to provide
high availability. Additionally, Aurora Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale the number of Aurora Replicas in response to read workloads, 
allowing you to meet the demand of unpredictable read workloads while maintaining high availability. This would provide an automated solution
for scaling the database to meet the demand of the application while maintaining high availability.

Option A, using Amazon Redshift with a single node for leader and compute functionality, would not provide high availability.
Option B, using Amazon RDS with a Single-AZ deployment and configuring RDS to add reader instances in a different Availability Zone, would not 
provide high availability and would not automatically scale the number of reader instances in response to read workloads.
Option D, using Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with EC2 Spot Instances, would not provide a database solution and would not meet the requirements

15. A company recently migrated to AWS and wants to implement a solution to protect the traffic that flows in and out of the production VPC. 
The company had an inspection server in its on-premises data center. The inspection server performed specific operations such as traffic flow inspection 
and traffic filtering. The company wants to have the same functionalities in the AWS Cloud.
Which solution will meet these requirements?

A. Use Amazon GuardDuty for traffic inspection and traffic filtering in the production VPC.
B. Use Traffic Mirroring to mirror traffic from the production VPC for traffic inspection and filtering.
C. Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
D. Use AWS Firewall Manager to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.



ans:
option C: Use AWS Network Firewall to create the required rules for traffic inspection and traffic filtering for the production VPC.
AWS Network Firewall is a managed firewall service that provides filtering for both inbound and outbound network traffic. 
It allows you to create rules for traffic inspection and filtering, which can help protect your production VPC.

Option A: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service, not a traffic inspection or filtering service.
Option B: Traffic Mirroring is a feature that allows you to replicate and send a copy of network traffic from a VPC to another VPC or 
on-premises location. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.
Option D: AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that helps you to centrally configure and manage firewalls 
across your accounts. It is not a service that performs traffic inspection or filtering.
