9. Handling Sold Automobile Listings in RDS
Question:
An automobile sales website needs to remove sold listings from the website and send data to multiple target systems. Which solution should the solutions architect recommend?

Answer: Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when RDS is updated, which sends the information to an SQS queue for multiple consumers.

Explanation:
- The Lambda function listens for RDS updates and pushes messages to SQS.
- Multiple consumers can process the queue messages asynchronously.
- FIFO queues are unnecessary since ordering is not a strict requirement.
- Using SNS adds unnecessary complexity when a queue alone can distribute messages to multiple consumers.

---

10. Preventing Object Modifications in S3
Question:
A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and prevent unauthorized modifications. Some users should be able to delete objects when necessary. What should be done?

Answer:Enable S3 Object Lock with legal holds and configure IAM permissions for deletion.

Explanation:
- S3 Object Lock prevents unauthorized modifications.
- Legal holds allow objects to remain unchangeable indefinitely until explicitly removed.
- IAM permissions ensure only authorized users can delete objects.
- Retention periods would impose fixed times, which is not required.

11. Optimizing Image Uploads in a Social Media Application
Question:
A social media company wants to improve image upload performance. Which two actions should be taken?

Answer:
Configure the application to upload images directly to S3 via pre-signed URLs.
Use S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function for image processing.

Explanation:
- Pre-signed URLs allow users to upload directly to S3, reducing web server load.
- Lambda processes images asynchronously after upload, improving performance.
- Using Glacier is unnecessary as data needs to be readily accessible.
-Uploading through the web server increases latency, which is already an issue.


How It Works:
Your web server generates a pre-signed URL using AWS SDKs. This URL includes temporary credentials that grant permission to upload a file to a specific S3 bucket.
The user (e.g., from a browser or mobile app) uses this pre-signed URL to upload their file directly to S3.
The upload happens without involving your web server, reducing the load on it.

Example Use Case:

Imagine a social media app where users upload profile pictures. Instead of sending the images to your backend server first, you:
Generate a pre-signed URL on the backend.
Send the URL to the user's browser.
The browser uploads the image directly to S3 using that URL.
Your backend just stores the file reference instead of handling the upload itself

22. Encrypting an Existing RDS Database and Snapshots
Scenario:
An online transaction workload is running on an unencrypted RDS DB instance (Multi-AZ).
Daily database snapshots are taken.
The goal is to ensure all future snapshots and the DB instance are encrypted.
Correct Answer: ✅ Create an encrypted copy of the latest DB snapshot, then restore a new DB instance from the encrypted snapshot.

Why?

RDS instances cannot be encrypted after creation.
The workaround is to take a snapshot, create an encrypted copy, and restore a new RDS instance from it.
Once the new instance is encrypted, all future snapshots will also be encrypted.

----


23. Key Management for Developers
Scenario: Developers need to encrypt data in their applications.
The company wants to reduce operational overhead for key management.
Correct Answer:✅ Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys.

It integrates seamlessly with AWS services like S3, RDS, and Lambda.
The other options (IAM policies, MFA, ACM certificates) do not address key management.


--------

24. SSL Termination & Load Balancing
Scenario: A dynamic web application is hosted on two EC2 instances.
SSL termination (HTTPS) is handled at each EC2 instance, which is causing high CPU utilization.
The goal is to offload SSL processing and improve performance.

Correct Answer: ✅ Import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for SSL termination.

Why?
ALB offloads SSL/TLS processing, reducing the CPU burden on EC2 instances.
ACM manages SSL certificates centrally, removing the need to install them manually on instances.


---------

25. Cost-Effective Batch Processing
Scenario: A stateless batch processing job runs on multiple EC2 instances.
The workload can start and stop at any time with no negative impact.
The company wants a scalable and cost-effective solution.

Correct Answer: ✅ Use EC2 Spot Instances to run the batch processing job.

Why?
Spot Instances offer the lowest cost for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.
Reserved Instances are for predictable workloads.
On-Demand Instances are too expensive for batch jobs.
AWS Lambda is not ideal because the job runs for over 60 minutes.


------

26. Private EC2 Instances with Internet Access
Scenario: EC2 instances and RDS instances should not be exposed to the public internet.
EC2 instances need internet access to process payments via a third-party web service.
The solution must be highly available.

Correct Answer: ✅ Deploy EC2 instances in a private subnet with a NAT Gateway in a public subnet. Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the public subnet.

Why?
Private EC2 instances need a NAT Gateway for outbound internet access.
The ALB is in a public subnet to allow external users to access the application.
RDS remains private, ensuring it is not directly exposed to the internet.

---------

27. Reducing S3 Storage Costs for Long-Term Data Retention
Scenario: Data is stored in the S3 Standard storage class.
Data must be retained for 25 years.
The last 2 years of data must be highly available and immediately retrievable.

Correct Answer:✅ Use an S3 Lifecycle Policy to transition objects to Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.

Why?
S3 Standard → Stores recent 2 years of data for high availability.
Glacier Deep Archive → Cheapest storage for long-term retention.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is not cost-effective because the transition time is predictable.

Why?
EC2 Instance Store → Provides the fastest storage for temporary high-performance workloads like video processing.
S3 Standard → Highly durable for frequently accessed media content.
S3 Glacier → Cost-effective for archiving large amounts of unused media.

--------

28(b). Archival Storage in AWS
Problem: The company is looking for an archival storage solution.

Solution: AWS S3 Glacier is suitable for archival storage due to its low-cost and long retrieval times. It ensures data is stored securely 
and cost-effectively over extended periods, making it ideal for storing infrequently accessed data.

Why not EBS?: Elastic Block Store (EBS) is not considered a good option in this scenario because it's designed for high-performance storage 
and is not cost-effective for archival purposes.

--------

29. EC2 Auto Scaling for Consistent Performance
Problem: EC2 instances behind an Auto Scaling group need to maintain a specific CPU utilization target (40%).

Solution: Use target tracking scaling policy in the Auto Scaling group. This dynamically adjusts the number of
instances to keep CPU utilization at or near 40%.

Why not other policies?: Target tracking scaling is the simplest and most direct way to maintain a specific performance metric.


-------

30. File Sharing with S3 and CloudFront
Problem: The company wants to serve files stored in an S3 bucket through CloudFront, but without direct 
access to the S3 URL.

Solution: Use Origin Access Identity (OAI) with CloudFront. This ensures that CloudFront is the only entity that can access the S3 bucket, 
preventing direct access via the S3 URL.

Why not other policies?: Writing individual S3 bucket policies is not ideal because OAI provides a cleaner and more manageable solution for restricting access.


-------

31. Scalable File Distribution Globally
Problem: A company needs to distribute downloadable historical reports globally with low cost and fast response times.

Solution: Use Amazon CloudFront with S3. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content closer to users, ensuring fast global access.

------

32. Oracle Database Migration and Disaster Recovery
Problem: A company is migrating an Oracle database to AWS and needs to ensure disaster recovery (DR) and minimal operational overhead.

Solution: Use Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. This allows for migration while maintaining the underlying operating system access (SSH access).

Why not standard RDS?: Standard RDS does not allow access to the underlying operating system, which is required for this migration.

------

32(b). Multi-Tier Web Application Migration
Problem: The company is migrating a multi-tier web application from on-premises infrastructure to AWS. The application uses PostgreSQL.

Solution: Migrate to Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL). Aurora provides scalability, high availability, and durability. Additionally, Amazon
Aurora minimizes operational overhead compared to traditional PostgreSQL setups.

Why not EC2 or Elastic Cache?: EC2 requires more manual management, and Elastic Cache is unnecessary here because there’s 
no mention of a caching layer in the requirements.


-------

33. Serverless Solution with S3 and Encryption
Problem: The company needs a serverless solution to analyze data stored in S3 that requires encryption and cross-region replication.

Solution: Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) with AWS KMS multi-region keys for encryption. Use Amazon Athena for querying the data.
Why not other solutions?: RDS is a database service and not appropriate for querying data stored in S3. The focus is on serverless solutions
and minimizing operational overhead.


-------

34. Private Connectivity to External Service
Problem: The company needs to connect to an external service hosted on a provider's VPC, with private access that restricts
connection initiation from the company's VPC.

Solution: Use VPC endpoint for private connectivity. A VPC endpoint provides a secure, private connection to external services in 
another VPC without traversing the public internet.

Why not other options?: Other solutions like Virtual Private Gateway or NAT Gateway are not designed for this scenario where 
direct private access to an external service is needed.

----------

35. Database Migration with AWS DMS
Problem: The company is migrating its on-premises PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, while keeping the on-premises 
database accessible during the migration.

Solution: Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for the migration while maintaining synchronization between the on-premises and Aurora databases.

Why not other options?: Creating a backup or using AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) are not needed for a straightforward PostgreSQL-to-PostgreSQL 
migration, and event bridge is unrelated to the migration process.


-------

36. Email Notifications for AWS Accounts
Problem: A company uses AWS Organizations, and notifications sent to the root user email address are missed. Future notifications 
should be sent to administrators.

Solution: Configure AWS root user email address distribution lists so that alerts are sent to administrators and not missed.

Why not other solutions?: Directly assigning an IAM user or setting up an S3 bucket policy won’t solve the problem of ensuring 
administrators receive notifications in a centralized and manageable manner.

------

37. Global Content Delivery
Problem: A company wants to serve content (news, weather, etc.) globally with low latency, ensuring fast and efficient content delivery.

Solution: Amazon CloudFront is the recommended solution. By using CloudFront, content can be delivered from the nearest edge location, reducing
latency and improving the user experience. CloudFront is specifically designed for serving both static and dynamic 
content, making it ideal for global distribution.

Best Option: Deploy the application in a single region and use CloudFront to serve content, specifying the ALB as the origin.


----

38. Highly Available UDP-Based Architecture

39. RabbitMQ on EC2 with Multi-AZ Deployment
Problem: A company is using RabbitMQ on EC2 instances within a single availability zone (AZ) and needs to increase high availability.

Solution: Migrate RabbitMQ to Amazon MQ, a managed service that offers high availability through multi-AZ deployments. Additionally,
the database should be moved to Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ) for PostgreSQL to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Best Option: Migrate the queue to Amazon MQ (active/standby pair), create a multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances,
and use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ) for the database.


-----

40. S3 File Movement and Integration with Lambda and SageMaker
Problem: The company needs to automatically move files from one S3 bucket to another and process them using AWS Lambda, with further integration 
into Amazon SageMaker pipelines.
Solution: S3 Cross-Region Replication combined with Amazon EventBridge allows for automatic file replication and integration
with other AWS services. S3 events trigger an EventBridge rule, which then invokes the Lambda function and integrates with SageMaker.

Best Option: Configure S3 replication and use EventBridge to forward events to Lambda and SageMaker pipelines.


***

41. Optimizing EC2 and Lambda Costs
Problem: The company needs to optimize costs for an application using EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda, with 
sporadic and unpredictable EC2 usage.
Solution: Spot Instances for the EC2 data ingestion layer, since they can be interrupted at any time and are cost-effective. 
For predictable workloads (such as Fargate and Lambda), using Savings Plans provides long-term cost savings.
Best Option: Use Spot Instances for EC2 and purchase a Compute Savings Plan for Fargate and Lambda.

***
Savings Plans in AWS are a flexible pricing model that helps you save money on your compute usage. Instead of reserving specific instances 
(like in Reserved Instances), Savings Plans allow you to commit to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) over a 1- or 3-year period. 
In return, AWS provides significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing.


and

The data ingestion layer is the first stage in a data pipeline where raw data is collected, processed, and moved into a storage or processing system. 
It ensures that data from various sources (databases, APIs, IoT devices, logs, etc.) is efficiently and reliably 
ingested into a data lake, data warehouse, or analytical system.

Key Components of the Data Ingestion Layer
Sources – The origins of the data, such as relational databases, cloud services, IoT devices, or logs.
Ingestion Mechanisms – The methods used to bring data in, like batch processing, real-time streaming, or hybrid approaches.
Transformation & Preprocessing – Cleaning, filtering, or enriching data before further processing.
Storage & Processing – Data is sent to storage solutions like Amazon S3, Redshift, or Snowflake for further use.

Types of Data Ingestion
Batch Ingestion – Data is collected and processed at scheduled intervals. (e.g., AWS Glue, Apache Nifi)
Real-time Streaming – Data is ingested continuously in real-time. (e.g., AWS Kinesis, Apache Kafka)
Hybrid Ingestion – A mix of batch and streaming, depending on use cases.

43(a). Migrating a Monolithic Application to AWS
Problem Statement: A company wants to migrate its existing on-premises monolithic application to AWS while keeping as much of 
the front-end and backend code intact. They want to break the application into smaller services, managed by different teams,
with a highly scalable solution that minimizes operational overhead.

Solution: Host the application on Elastic Container Service (ECS), set up an application load balancer with ECS as the target.

Explanation: The best solution here is to containerize the application using ECS. ECS is highly scalable and offers two options
(EC2 and Fargate) for managing containers. Since the goal is to reduce operational overhead, ECS with Fargate is a great choice because
it eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances manually. ECS also allows easy scaling, which is ideal for a microservices-based architecture.


-----
43(b). Containerized Stateless Applications on AWS
Problem: The company wants to run stateless applications in containers that can tolerate infrastructure disruptions, 
while minimizing cost and operational overhead.

Solution: Use Amazon EKS with spot instances for containerized applications. Spot instances are cost-effective and can be used in
environments that can handle interruptions.
Why not EC2 Auto Scaling Groups?: EC2 is not ideal here since the applications are stateless and the requirement is to minimize costs while still
ensuring scalability. Spot instances are the more cost-effective solution.



---

44. Aurora Performance Issues During Report Generation
Problem Statement: The company is using Amazon Aurora for its e-commerce application. When large reports are generated, developers notice that read
IOPS and CPU utilization spike, causing performance degradation.

Solution: Migrate the monthly reporting workload to an Aurora read replica.

Explanation: The issue arises due to heavy read traffic during report generation. Aurora's read replica feature allows offloading read operations
from the primary database, which reduces the load on the main database and improves performance. By moving reporting queries to a read replica,
the main Aurora instance can handle transactional workloads more effectively.


----
45. Scaling an EC2-based Analytics Application
Problem Statement: A company is hosting a web analytics application on a single EC2 instance. The application is showing signs of 
performance degradation, especially under heavy load, with 500 errors occurring. The company needs a cost-effective solution that allows seamless scaling.

Solution: Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL, create an AMI of the web application, apply it to a launch template,
create an Auto Scaling group, and attach an Application Load Balancer.

Explanation: The 500 error typically indicates server overload, so introducing Auto Scaling is key to handling traffic spikes automatically.
Migrating the database to Aurora improves the database performance, as it is more efficient than MySQL hosted on EC2.
Using an Auto Scaling group ensures that the EC2 instances scale in response to varying load. The Application Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly among instances.


*******
"MySQL hosted on EC2" means that you are running a MySQL database on an AWS EC2 instance instead of using a managed database service like Amazon RDS.

How It Works

You launch an EC2 instance
Choose an Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or any OS that supports MySQL.

You install MySQL manually
Example for Ubuntu: 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server -y

You configure MySQL
Secure MySQL:
sudo mysql_secure_installation

Create users, databases, and set permissions.

You allow remote access (optional)
Modify /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf (or /etc/my.cnf on Amazon Linux).
Change bind-address = 0.0.0.0 to allow external connections.
Open port 3306 in your security group.

Why Host MySQL on EC2 Instead of RDS?
✅ More control – You handle configurations, backups, and optimizations.
✅ Cheaper for small workloads – No extra RDS management costs.
✅ Custom MySQL versions – Choose any MySQL version or even MariaDB.
✅ Run other apps on the same server – Example: LAMP/LEMP stack (Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP).

A stateless web application is a type of web application where each request from a client (browser, API call, etc.) is treated as an independent transaction, 
without relying on any previous requests.

This means the server does not store client session data between requests. Instead, all necessary information is included in each
request or stored externally (e.g., in a database, cache, or cookies).

----
46. EC2 Instances for a Stateless Web Application
Problem Statement: A stateless web application runs on EC2 on-demand instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application 
experiences heavy usage during business hours and moderate usage overnight. The company needs a cost-effective solution to handle this load.

Solution: Use reserved instances for the baseline level of usage and spot instances for any additional capacity.

Explanation: Reserved instances are ideal for the predictable, baseline usage that occurs during the 8-hour workday. 
Spot instances, which offer significant cost savings, can be used during off-peak hours (overnight or weekends) when the load is moderate to low. 
This hybrid approach optimizes cost without sacrificing performance.


----
47. Retaining Application Logs for 10 Years
Problem Statement: A company needs to retain application logs for 10 years. Logs generated for the past month are frequently accessed for troubleshooting,
but older logs are rarely accessed. The company generates over 10 TB of logs per month.

Solution: Store the logs in Amazon S3 and use S3 lifecycle policies to move logs older than one month to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Explanation: Storing logs in S3 allows for scalable storage. S3 lifecycle policies automate the process of moving older logs to Glacier Deep Archive,
which is highly cost-effective for long-term storage, while logs that are frequently accessed can remain in S3. This meets the company's 
retention requirement and ensures cost efficiency.


----
48 - Data Ingestion Workflow Failing Due to Connectivity Issues
Problem Statement: A company has an SNS topic that triggers a Lambda function to process and store data. However, the workflow occasionally fails due to network 
connectivity issues, and the corresponding data isn't ingested unless manually retried.

Solution: Configure an SQS queue as the on-failure destination and modify the Lambda function to process messages from the queue.

Explanation: Using SQS as an on-failure destination ensures that any failed notifications are placed in a queue and retried until 
they are successfully processed. This solves the problem of data not being ingested during network failures, ensuring that the ingestion 
workflow is more resilient and fault-tolerant.


----
49.  Event Data Processing with Order Preservation
Problem Statement: The company has a service that produces event data, which needs to be processed in order as it is received. The 
company wants to minimize operational overhead.

Solution: Use a FIFO queue in SQS to ensure event data is processed in order.

Explanation: When event data needs to be processed in a specific order, SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are ideal. FIFO queues ensure that messages
are processed in the exact order they are received, which is crucial when the order of event processing is important.

50. Monitoring EC2 Instances for CPU and IOPS
Problem Statement: A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to EC2 instances. The company needs to implement metric
alarms, where they don't need to take action for short CPU bursts, but if both CPU utilization and read IOPS(i/p o/p operatn per sec) are high simultaneously, 
immediate action is needed. The company also wants to reduce false alarms.

Solution: Create a composite CloudWatch alarm that monitors multiple metrics.

Explanation: A composite CloudWatch alarm is used to combine multiple metric alarms into one. It only triggers if all conditions are met.
In this case, the composite alarm would monitor both CPU utilization and read IOPS. This ensures that the alarm is only triggered when both conditions are true, 
reducing false alarms. This approach is optimal for situations where a short burst of CPU usage is not a concern,
but a sustained high load across both CPU and IOPS requires attention.
