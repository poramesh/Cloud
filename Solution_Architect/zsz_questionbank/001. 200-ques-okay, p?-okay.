9. Handling Sold Automobile Listings in RDS
Question:
An automobile sales website needs to remove sold listings from the website and send data to multiple target systems. Which solution should the solutions architect recommend?

Answer: Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when RDS is updated, which sends the information to an SQS queue for multiple consumers.

Explanation:
- The Lambda function listens for RDS updates and pushes messages to SQS.
- Multiple consumers can process the queue messages asynchronously.
- FIFO queues are unnecessary since ordering is not a strict requirement.
- Using SNS adds unnecessary complexity when a queue alone can distribute messages to multiple consumers.

---

10. Preventing Object Modifications in S3
Question:
A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and prevent unauthorized modifications. Some users should be able to delete objects when necessary. What should be done?

Answer:Enable S3 Object Lock with legal holds and configure IAM permissions for deletion.

Explanation:
- S3 Object Lock prevents unauthorized modifications.
- Legal holds allow objects to remain unchangeable indefinitely until explicitly removed.
- IAM permissions ensure only authorized users can delete objects.
- Retention periods would impose fixed times, which is not required.

11. Optimizing Image Uploads in a Social Media Application
Question:
A social media company wants to improve image upload performance. Which two actions should be taken?

Answer:
Configure the application to upload images directly to S3 via pre-signed URLs.
Use S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function for image processing.

Explanation:
- Pre-signed URLs allow users to upload directly to S3, reducing web server load.
- Lambda processes images asynchronously after upload, improving performance.
- Using Glacier is unnecessary as data needs to be readily accessible.
-Uploading through the web server increases latency, which is already an issue.


How It Works:
Your web server generates a pre-signed URL using AWS SDKs. This URL includes temporary credentials that grant permission to upload a file to a specific S3 bucket.
The user (e.g., from a browser or mobile app) uses this pre-signed URL to upload their file directly to S3.
The upload happens without involving your web server, reducing the load on it.

Example Use Case:

Imagine a social media app where users upload profile pictures. Instead of sending the images to your backend server first, you:
Generate a pre-signed URL on the backend.
Send the URL to the user's browser.
The browser uploads the image directly to S3 using that URL.
Your backend just stores the file reference instead of handling the upload itself

22. Encrypting an Existing RDS Database and Snapshots
Scenario:
An online transaction workload is running on an unencrypted RDS DB instance (Multi-AZ).
Daily database snapshots are taken.
The goal is to ensure all future snapshots and the DB instance are encrypted.
Correct Answer: ✅ Create an encrypted copy of the latest DB snapshot, then restore a new DB instance from the encrypted snapshot.

Why?

RDS instances cannot be encrypted after creation.
The workaround is to take a snapshot, create an encrypted copy, and restore a new RDS instance from it.
Once the new instance is encrypted, all future snapshots will also be encrypted.

----


23. Key Management for Developers
Scenario: Developers need to encrypt data in their applications.
The company wants to reduce operational overhead for key management.
Correct Answer:✅ Use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to manage encryption keys.

It integrates seamlessly with AWS services like S3, RDS, and Lambda.
The other options (IAM policies, MFA, ACM certificates) do not address key management.


--------

24. SSL Termination & Load Balancing
Scenario: A dynamic web application is hosted on two EC2 instances.
SSL termination (HTTPS) is handled at each EC2 instance, which is causing high CPU utilization.
The goal is to offload SSL processing and improve performance.

Correct Answer: ✅ Import the SSL certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) and use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) for SSL termination.

Why?
ALB offloads SSL/TLS processing, reducing the CPU burden on EC2 instances.
ACM manages SSL certificates centrally, removing the need to install them manually on instances.


---------

25. Cost-Effective Batch Processing
Scenario: A stateless batch processing job runs on multiple EC2 instances.
The workload can start and stop at any time with no negative impact.
The company wants a scalable and cost-effective solution.

Correct Answer: ✅ Use EC2 Spot Instances to run the batch processing job.

Why?
Spot Instances offer the lowest cost for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.
Reserved Instances are for predictable workloads.
On-Demand Instances are too expensive for batch jobs.
AWS Lambda is not ideal because the job runs for over 60 minutes.


------

26. Private EC2 Instances with Internet Access
Scenario: EC2 instances and RDS instances should not be exposed to the public internet.
EC2 instances need internet access to process payments via a third-party web service.
The solution must be highly available.

Correct Answer: ✅ Deploy EC2 instances in a private subnet with a NAT Gateway in a public subnet. Use an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the public subnet.

Why?
Private EC2 instances need a NAT Gateway for outbound internet access.
The ALB is in a public subnet to allow external users to access the application.
RDS remains private, ensuring it is not directly exposed to the internet.

---------

27. Reducing S3 Storage Costs for Long-Term Data Retention
Scenario: Data is stored in the S3 Standard storage class.
Data must be retained for 25 years.
The last 2 years of data must be highly available and immediately retrievable.

Correct Answer:✅ Use an S3 Lifecycle Policy to transition objects to Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.

Why?
S3 Standard → Stores recent 2 years of data for high availability.
Glacier Deep Archive → Cheapest storage for long-term retention.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is not cost-effective because the transition time is predictable.

Why?
EC2 Instance Store → Provides the fastest storage for temporary high-performance workloads like video processing.
S3 Standard → Highly durable for frequently accessed media content.
S3 Glacier → Cost-effective for archiving large amounts of unused media.

--------

28(b). Archival Storage in AWS
Problem: The company is looking for an archival storage solution.

Solution: AWS S3 Glacier is suitable for archival storage due to its low-cost and long retrieval times. It ensures data is stored securely 
and cost-effectively over extended periods, making it ideal for storing infrequently accessed data.

Why not EBS?: Elastic Block Store (EBS) is not considered a good option in this scenario because it's designed for high-performance storage 
and is not cost-effective for archival purposes.

--------

29. EC2 Auto Scaling for Consistent Performance
Problem: EC2 instances behind an Auto Scaling group need to maintain a specific CPU utilization target (40%).

Solution: Use target tracking scaling policy in the Auto Scaling group. This dynamically adjusts the number of
instances to keep CPU utilization at or near 40%.

Why not other policies?: Target tracking scaling is the simplest and most direct way to maintain a specific performance metric.


-------

30. File Sharing with S3 and CloudFront
Problem: The company wants to serve files stored in an S3 bucket through CloudFront, but without direct 
access to the S3 URL.

Solution: Use Origin Access Identity (OAI) with CloudFront. This ensures that CloudFront is the only entity that can access the S3 bucket, 
preventing direct access via the S3 URL.

Why not other policies?: Writing individual S3 bucket policies is not ideal because OAI provides a cleaner and more manageable solution for restricting access.


-------

31. Scalable File Distribution Globally
Problem: A company needs to distribute downloadable historical reports globally with low cost and fast response times.

Solution: Use Amazon CloudFront with S3. CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that caches content closer to users, ensuring fast global access.

------

32. Oracle Database Migration and Disaster Recovery
Problem: A company is migrating an Oracle database to AWS and needs to ensure disaster recovery (DR) and minimal operational overhead.

Solution: Use Amazon RDS Custom for Oracle. This allows for migration while maintaining the underlying operating system access (SSH access).

Why not standard RDS?: Standard RDS does not allow access to the underlying operating system, which is required for this migration.

------

32(b). Multi-Tier Web Application Migration
Problem: The company is migrating a multi-tier web application from on-premises infrastructure to AWS. The application uses PostgreSQL.

Solution: Migrate to Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL). Aurora provides scalability, high availability, and durability. Additionally, Amazon
Aurora minimizes operational overhead compared to traditional PostgreSQL setups.

Why not EC2 or Elastic Cache?: EC2 requires more manual management, and Elastic Cache is unnecessary here because there’s 
no mention of a caching layer in the requirements.


-------

33. Serverless Solution with S3 and Encryption
Problem: The company needs a serverless solution to analyze data stored in S3 that requires encryption and cross-region replication.

Solution: Use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) with AWS KMS multi-region keys for encryption. Use Amazon Athena for querying the data.
Why not other solutions?: RDS is a database service and not appropriate for querying data stored in S3. The focus is on serverless solutions
and minimizing operational overhead.


-------

34. Private Connectivity to External Service
Problem: The company needs to connect to an external service hosted on a provider's VPC, with private access that restricts
connection initiation from the company's VPC.

Solution: Use VPC endpoint for private connectivity. A VPC endpoint provides a secure, private connection to external services in 
another VPC without traversing the public internet.

Why not other options?: Other solutions like Virtual Private Gateway or NAT Gateway are not designed for this scenario where 
direct private access to an external service is needed.

----------

35. Database Migration with AWS DMS
Problem: The company is migrating its on-premises PostgreSQL database to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL, while keeping the on-premises 
database accessible during the migration.

Solution: Use AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) for the migration while maintaining synchronization between the on-premises and Aurora databases.

Why not other options?: Creating a backup or using AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) are not needed for a straightforward PostgreSQL-to-PostgreSQL 
migration, and event bridge is unrelated to the migration process.


-------

36. Email Notifications for AWS Accounts
Problem: A company uses AWS Organizations, and notifications sent to the root user email address are missed. Future notifications 
should be sent to administrators.

Solution: Configure AWS root user email address distribution lists so that alerts are sent to administrators and not missed.

Why not other solutions?: Directly assigning an IAM user or setting up an S3 bucket policy won’t solve the problem of ensuring 
administrators receive notifications in a centralized and manageable manner.

------

37. Global Content Delivery
Problem: A company wants to serve content (news, weather, etc.) globally with low latency, ensuring fast and efficient content delivery.

Solution: Amazon CloudFront is the recommended solution. By using CloudFront, content can be delivered from the nearest edge location, reducing
latency and improving the user experience. CloudFront is specifically designed for serving both static and dynamic 
content, making it ideal for global distribution.

Best Option: Deploy the application in a single region and use CloudFront to serve content, specifying the ALB as the origin.


----

38. Highly Available UDP-Based Architecture

39. RabbitMQ on EC2 with Multi-AZ Deployment
Problem: A company is using RabbitMQ on EC2 instances within a single availability zone (AZ) and needs to increase high availability.

Solution: Migrate RabbitMQ to Amazon MQ, a managed service that offers high availability through multi-AZ deployments. Additionally,
the database should be moved to Amazon RDS (Multi-AZ) for PostgreSQL to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Best Option: Migrate the queue to Amazon MQ (active/standby pair), create a multi-AZ Auto Scaling group for EC2 instances,
and use Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL (Multi-AZ) for the database.


-----

40. S3 File Movement and Integration with Lambda and SageMaker
Problem: The company needs to automatically move files from one S3 bucket to another and process them using AWS Lambda, with further integration 
into Amazon SageMaker pipelines.
Solution: S3 Cross-Region Replication combined with Amazon EventBridge allows for automatic file replication and integration
with other AWS services. S3 events trigger an EventBridge rule, which then invokes the Lambda function and integrates with SageMaker.

Best Option: Configure S3 replication and use EventBridge to forward events to Lambda and SageMaker pipelines.


***

41. Optimizing EC2 and Lambda Costs
Problem: The company needs to optimize costs for an application using EC2, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda, with 
sporadic and unpredictable EC2 usage.
Solution: Spot Instances for the EC2 data ingestion layer, since they can be interrupted at any time and are cost-effective. 
For predictable workloads (such as Fargate and Lambda), using Savings Plans provides long-term cost savings.
Best Option: Use Spot Instances for EC2 and purchase a Compute Savings Plan for Fargate and Lambda.

***
Savings Plans in AWS are a flexible pricing model that helps you save money on your compute usage. Instead of reserving specific instances 
(like in Reserved Instances), Savings Plans allow you to commit to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) over a 1- or 3-year period. 
In return, AWS provides significant discounts compared to on-demand pricing.


and

The data ingestion layer is the first stage in a data pipeline where raw data is collected, processed, and moved into a storage or processing system. 
It ensures that data from various sources (databases, APIs, IoT devices, logs, etc.) is efficiently and reliably 
ingested into a data lake, data warehouse, or analytical system.

Key Components of the Data Ingestion Layer
Sources – The origins of the data, such as relational databases, cloud services, IoT devices, or logs.
Ingestion Mechanisms – The methods used to bring data in, like batch processing, real-time streaming, or hybrid approaches.
Transformation & Preprocessing – Cleaning, filtering, or enriching data before further processing.
Storage & Processing – Data is sent to storage solutions like Amazon S3, Redshift, or Snowflake for further use.

Types of Data Ingestion
Batch Ingestion – Data is collected and processed at scheduled intervals. (e.g., AWS Glue, Apache Nifi)
Real-time Streaming – Data is ingested continuously in real-time. (e.g., AWS Kinesis, Apache Kafka)
Hybrid Ingestion – A mix of batch and streaming, depending on use cases.

43(a). Migrating a Monolithic Application to AWS
Problem Statement: A company wants to migrate its existing on-premises monolithic application to AWS while keeping as much of 
the front-end and backend code intact. They want to break the application into smaller services, managed by different teams,
with a highly scalable solution that minimizes operational overhead.

Solution: Host the application on Elastic Container Service (ECS), set up an application load balancer with ECS as the target.

Explanation: The best solution here is to containerize the application using ECS. ECS is highly scalable and offers two options
(EC2 and Fargate) for managing containers. Since the goal is to reduce operational overhead, ECS with Fargate is a great choice because
it eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances manually. ECS also allows easy scaling, which is ideal for a microservices-based architecture.


-----
43(b). Containerized Stateless Applications on AWS
Problem: The company wants to run stateless applications in containers that can tolerate infrastructure disruptions, 
while minimizing cost and operational overhead.

Solution: Use Amazon EKS with spot instances for containerized applications. Spot instances are cost-effective and can be used in
environments that can handle interruptions.
Why not EC2 Auto Scaling Groups?: EC2 is not ideal here since the applications are stateless and the requirement is to minimize costs while still
ensuring scalability. Spot instances are the more cost-effective solution.



---

44. Aurora Performance Issues During Report Generation
Problem Statement: The company is using Amazon Aurora for its e-commerce application. When large reports are generated, developers notice that read
IOPS and CPU utilization spike, causing performance degradation.

Solution: Migrate the monthly reporting workload to an Aurora read replica.

Explanation: The issue arises due to heavy read traffic during report generation. Aurora's read replica feature allows offloading read operations
from the primary database, which reduces the load on the main database and improves performance. By moving reporting queries to a read replica,
the main Aurora instance can handle transactional workloads more effectively.


----
45. Scaling an EC2-based Analytics Application
Problem Statement: A company is hosting a web analytics application on a single EC2 instance. The application is showing signs of 
performance degradation, especially under heavy load, with 500 errors occurring. The company needs a cost-effective solution that allows seamless scaling.

Solution: Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora MySQL, create an AMI of the web application, apply it to a launch template,
create an Auto Scaling group, and attach an Application Load Balancer.

Explanation: The 500 error typically indicates server overload, so introducing Auto Scaling is key to handling traffic spikes automatically.
Migrating the database to Aurora improves the database performance, as it is more efficient than MySQL hosted on EC2.
Using an Auto Scaling group ensures that the EC2 instances scale in response to varying load. The Application Load Balancer distributes traffic evenly among instances.


*******
"MySQL hosted on EC2" means that you are running a MySQL database on an AWS EC2 instance instead of using a managed database service like Amazon RDS.

How It Works

You launch an EC2 instance
Choose an Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, or any OS that supports MySQL.

You install MySQL manually
Example for Ubuntu: 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server -y

You configure MySQL
Secure MySQL:
sudo mysql_secure_installation

Create users, databases, and set permissions.

You allow remote access (optional)
Modify /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf (or /etc/my.cnf on Amazon Linux).
Change bind-address = 0.0.0.0 to allow external connections.
Open port 3306 in your security group.

Why Host MySQL on EC2 Instead of RDS?
✅ More control – You handle configurations, backups, and optimizations.
✅ Cheaper for small workloads – No extra RDS management costs.
✅ Custom MySQL versions – Choose any MySQL version or even MariaDB.
✅ Run other apps on the same server – Example: LAMP/LEMP stack (Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL, PHP).

A stateless web application is a type of web application where each request from a client (browser, API call, etc.) is treated as an independent transaction, 
without relying on any previous requests.

This means the server does not store client session data between requests. Instead, all necessary information is included in each
request or stored externally (e.g., in a database, cache, or cookies).

----
46. EC2 Instances for a Stateless Web Application
Problem Statement: A stateless web application runs on EC2 on-demand instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The application 
experiences heavy usage during business hours and moderate usage overnight. The company needs a cost-effective solution to handle this load.

Solution: Use reserved instances for the baseline level of usage and spot instances for any additional capacity.

Explanation: Reserved instances are ideal for the predictable, baseline usage that occurs during the 8-hour workday. 
Spot instances, which offer significant cost savings, can be used during off-peak hours (overnight or weekends) when the load is moderate to low. 
This hybrid approach optimizes cost without sacrificing performance.


----
47. Retaining Application Logs for 10 Years
Problem Statement: A company needs to retain application logs for 10 years. Logs generated for the past month are frequently accessed for troubleshooting,
but older logs are rarely accessed. The company generates over 10 TB of logs per month.

Solution: Store the logs in Amazon S3 and use S3 lifecycle policies to move logs older than one month to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Explanation: Storing logs in S3 allows for scalable storage. S3 lifecycle policies automate the process of moving older logs to Glacier Deep Archive,
which is highly cost-effective for long-term storage, while logs that are frequently accessed can remain in S3. This meets the company's 
retention requirement and ensures cost efficiency.


--------
48 - Data Ingestion Workflow Failing Due to Connectivity Issues
Problem Statement: A company has an SNS topic that triggers a Lambda function to process and store data. However, the workflow occasionally fails due to network 
connectivity issues, and the corresponding data isn't ingested unless manually retried.

Solution: Configure an SQS queue as the on-failure destination and modify the Lambda function to process messages from the queue.

Explanation: Using SQS as an on-failure destination ensures that any failed notifications are placed in a queue and retried until 
they are successfully processed. This solves the problem of data not being ingested during network failures, ensuring that the ingestion 
workflow is more resilient and fault-tolerant.


---------
49.  Event Data Processing with Order Preservation
Problem Statement: The company has a service that produces event data, which needs to be processed in order as it is received. The 
company wants to minimize operational overhead.

Solution: Use a FIFO queue in SQS to ensure event data is processed in order.

Explanation: When event data needs to be processed in a specific order, SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are ideal. FIFO queues ensure that messages
are processed in the exact order they are received, which is crucial when the order of event processing is important.

50. Monitoring EC2 Instances for CPU and IOPS
Problem Statement: A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to EC2 instances. The company needs to implement metric
alarms, where they don't need to take action for short CPU bursts, but if both CPU utilization and read IOPS(i/p o/p operatn per sec) are high simultaneously, 
immediate action is needed. The company also wants to reduce false alarms.

Solution: Create a composite CloudWatch alarm that monitors multiple metrics.

Explanation: A composite CloudWatch alarm is used to combine multiple metric alarms into one. It only triggers if all conditions are met.
In this case, the composite alarm would monitor both CPU utilization and read IOPS. This ensures that the alarm is only triggered when both conditions are true, 
reducing false alarms. This approach is optimal for situations where a short burst of CPU usage is not a concern,
but a sustained high load across both CPU and IOPS requires attention.

51. Migrating On-Premises Data Center to AWS (AP-Northeast-3 Region, No Internet Access)
Scenario: A company is migrating its on-premises data center to AWS but has strict compliance requirements:
Only AP-Northeast-3 region can be used.
VPCs cannot be connected to the internet (i.e., no public access).
Need centralized access control.

Correct Solutions:
✅ (A) AWS Control Tower
Control Tower helps set up and manage a secure multi-account AWS environment.
It allows implementing data residency guardrails to restrict data to a specific AWS region.
It can deny internet access by enforcing security policies centrally.
✅ (C) AWS Organizations + Service Control Policies (SCPs)
AWS Organizations allows managing multiple accounts under a single organization.
SCPs help enforce region-based restrictions (e.g., deny all regions except AP-Northeast-3).
SCPs also prevent VPCs from accessing the internet at an organizational level.

Incorrect Solutions:
❌ (B) AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
AWS WAF is used for application-layer security (e.g., blocking SQL injection, XSS attacks).
The question is about restricting network access, not security threats.
❌ (D) Network ACLs (NACLs) for VPCs
NACLs are specific to a VPC, not a centralized organization-wide restriction.
The requirement is to control multiple VPCs centrally, which NACLs cannot do.
❌ (E) AWS Config
AWS Config monitors compliance and can send alerts but does not prevent actions.
It cannot block internet access; it only reports violations.
Final Answer: (A) AWS Control Tower & (C) AWS Organizations with SCPs

Downloads are infrequent for files older than 90 days.
The company wants to minimize storage costs.

Correct Solution:
✅ (B) Move files to S3 Intelligent-Tiering
S3 Intelligent-Tiering automatically moves objects to lower-cost storage classes based on usage.
If a file is not accessed for 90 days, it moves to a cheaper tier (including Glacier if needed).
It is ideal for unpredictable access patterns.

Incorrect Solutions:
❌ (D) Move files to S3 Infrequent Access (IA) after 90 days
S3 IA is cheaper than S3 Standard but does not move objects to Glacier, which could save more cost.
Final Answer: (B) S3 Intelligent-Tiering

------

Scenario:
A company stores medical trial data in Amazon S3.
Scientists can add files, but nobody can modify or delete them.
Each file must be retained for 1 year (365 days).
Correct Solution:
✅ (A) Enable S3 Object Lock (Compliance Mode) with 365-day Retention

Object Lock enforces WORM (Write Once, Read Many) storage.
Compliance Mode ensures that even administrators cannot delete/modify objects before the retention period ends.
Incorrect Solutions:
❌ (B) IAM Role Restrictions

IAM cannot prevent S3 object deletions at the storage level.
❌ (C) Lambda Function to Restrict Deletes

Adding Lambda increases complexity without enforcing immutability.

---

This document provides **practice questions** and **detailed explanations** to help AWS certification aspirants understand key concepts. Regular practice and concept clarity are key to success!




1. Question on Reserved Instances vs. On-Demand Instances
Question: "Use Reserved Instances for baseline capacity and On-Demand instances to handle additional capacity" - I think D is the correct answer. Why is that? Why can’t we go with C?"

Scenario: The goal here is to handle fluctuating traffic with no downtime, and you’re considering how to manage the infrastructure in a cost-effective manner.

Correct Answer: D (Use Reserved Instances for baseline capacity and On-Demand instances to handle additional capacity)

Explanation:

Reserved Instances (RIs) are cost-effective for predictable workloads because you commit to a certain amount of capacity for a longer term (1-3 years). This covers your "baseline" needs, which are the regular, ongoing demands of your application.
On-Demand Instances give you flexibility to scale up when there are spikes in traffic, like during the holiday season. You only pay for them when they’re used, making them cost-effective for variable demand.
The reason Option C isn’t ideal here is because the question emphasizes the need for no downtime. While On-Demand Instances alone could offer flexibility, using only On-Demand instances might not provide the stability and lower cost that Reserved Instances can offer for the baseline load. Without Reserved Instances, your system may not be as cost-effective in the long run.

2. Question on Managing Permissions across Multiple AWS Accounts
Question: "A security team wants to limit access to specific services or actions in all of the team’s AWS accounts. All accounts belong to a large organization. The solution must be scalable and there must be a single point where permissions can be maintained. What should a Solutions Architect do?"

Scenario: The organization needs a solution for centralized, scalable permission management across multiple AWS accounts.

Correct Answer: D (Use Service Control Policies (SCPs))

Explanation:

Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations are specifically designed to manage and enforce policies at the organization level across multiple AWS accounts.
You can apply permissions at the organization level (across all AWS accounts in the organization), ensuring that the security policies are consistent and scalable.
SCPs can limit which services or actions are allowed across multiple accounts, which is exactly what the question is asking for.
Why not other options?

Access Control Lists (ACLs): These are typically used at the network layer to control access to S3 buckets or VPCs, not for managing service permissions.
Security Groups: They control access at the network layer (for EC2 instances and other resources in a VPC), not at the service or account level.
Account-level rules: These would require managing permissions individually for each account, which is not scalable and doesn't meet the "single point of maintenance" requirement.
Thus, SCPs are the correct option for centralized and scalable permission management across multiple AWS accounts.

3. Question on Reducing DDOS Attack Risks for a Web Application
Question: "A company is concerned about the security of its public web application due to recent web attacks. The application uses an ALB. The Solutions Architect must reduce the risk of DDOS attacks."

Scenario: The company needs to mitigate the risk of DDOS attacks on a web application running behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

Correct Answer: Shield Advanced

Explanation:

AWS Shield Advanced is a DDOS protection service designed specifically for mitigating large-scale, complex DDOS attacks. It offers 24/7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT) and protections against infrastructure layer attacks, which is what you need to protect your ALB.
Why not other options?

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall): While WAF is great for blocking malicious web traffic (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), it doesn’t specifically mitigate large-scale DDOS attacks. It operates at the application layer, whereas Shield Advanced operates at a network layer to handle large-scale attacks.
Mackie (probably a typo) and AWS GuardDuty: GuardDuty is more for threat detection in your AWS environment, not specifically designed for DDOS protection.
So, Shield Advanced is the correct answer because it directly addresses DDOS protection.

4. Question on Restricting Application Access from Specific Countries
Question: "A company’s web application is running on Amazon EC2 instances behind an ALB. The company recently changed its policy, requiring the application to be accessed from one specific country only. What should you do?"

Scenario: The company needs to restrict access to its web application based on geographic location (specifically a single country).

Correct Answer: B (Use AWS WAF with geo-blocking)

Explanation:

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) can be used to restrict access based on geographic location (country). You can create geo-match rules that allow or block requests from certain countries.
By configuring AWS WAF, you can control traffic to your ALB based on the geolocation of the IP addresses making the requests.
Why not other options?

Security Groups: These work at the network level, controlling inbound/outbound traffic based on IP addresses, but they do not support geolocation filtering.
Network ACLs: Similar to Security Groups but at the subnet level, and do not support geolocation either.
Thus, AWS WAF is the correct option for restricting access based on geographic location.

5. Question on Handling Increased API Requests During High Traffic
Question: "A company provides an API to its users that automates inquiries for tax computations based on item prices. During the holiday season, the company experiences a large number of inquiries, which cause slower response times. The solution should be scalable and elastic. What should a Solutions Architect do?"

Scenario: The company’s API is experiencing a traffic spike and needs to be scalable and elastic to handle the increased load.

Correct Answer: D (Use Amazon API Gateway with AWS Lambda)

Explanation:

Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed, serverless API gateway that is scalable and elastic. It can handle large numbers of API requests, automatically scaling up to handle increased load during high-traffic periods like holidays.
AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs code in response to events (like API requests) without provisioning or managing servers. It scales automatically based on demand.
Why not other options?

EC2 instances: Using EC2 instances would require manual scaling and provisioning, which is not as elastic as serverless options like API Gateway and Lambda.
Load balancers and other traditional server-based solutions are less efficient when scalability and elasticity are key concerns for this scenario.
Thus, Amazon API Gateway with Lambda is the best solution for this elastic and scalable API architecture.

6. Question on Using CloudFront for Media Distribution
Question: "A gaming company hosts a browser-based application on AWS. The users of the application consume a large number of videos and images that are stored in Amazon S3. This content is the same for all users. The application has increased in popularity, and millions of users worldwide are accessing these media files. The company wants to reduce the load on the origin."

Scenario: The company wants to efficiently distribute content (videos/images) to users worldwide while reducing load on the S3 origin.

Correct Answer: B (Use Amazon CloudFront)

Explanation:

Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that caches copies of your media files at edge locations close to users. This reduces the load on the S3 origin by serving cached content to users globally, ensuring low latency and reducing S3 requests.
Why not other options?

Direct S3 access: While possible, it would result in high latency and increased load on your S3 buckets, as the content would be fetched from the origin on every request.
Other solutions would not offer the same performance optimization across global users as CloudFront does.
Thus, CloudFront is the best option for content distribution and reducing load on the origin.




uestion 1:
Scenario: A solutions architect needs to prevent timeout errors while making the least possible changes to the application.

Answer: The correct answer is Amazon RDS Proxy.

Explanation:

RDS Proxy acts as a middle layer between your application and Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), especially useful when the application has multiple database connections. It helps handle connection pooling and ensures that you don't hit connection limits, thereby preventing timeout errors.
Read Replicas or Database Migration are not relevant because the problem here isn't about scaling the database or migrating to a different system.
Lambda is not required in this case since the issue is with database connections, not with the application logic running in Lambda.
Question 2:
Scenario: An application running in EC2 instances in private subnets needs to access DynamoDB.

Answer: The correct answer is VPC Endpoint.

Explanation:

When an EC2 instance in a private subnet needs to access a service like DynamoDB, the recommended solution is to use a VPC Endpoint. This allows traffic between your VPC and DynamoDB to stay within the AWS network, without traversing the public internet.
Gateway Endpoints are also an option when you want to minimize costs, but if no such option is available, you should choose a VPC Endpoint.
This ensures private and secure access without exposing resources to the public internet.
Question 3:
Scenario: A company is using DynamoDB and needs to improve performance for read-intensive workloads.

Answer: The correct answer is DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX).

Explanation:

DAX is a fully managed in-memory cache for DynamoDB. It is designed to accelerate read-intensive workloads by providing microsecond response times, making it the best choice for read-heavy applications.
Read Replicas are typically used with RDS, not DynamoDB.
Elasticache is not directly required here, as DAX is specifically tailored for DynamoDB.
Global Tables are designed for replication across AWS regions, which is not necessary in this case.
Question 4:
Scenario: A company wants to back up its EC2 instances and RDS DB instances in a separate region.

Answer: The correct answer is AWS Backup.

Explanation:

AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that simplifies the backup process. It supports both EC2 instances and RDS DB instances and can copy backups across regions with minimal operational overhead.
Using EBS snapshots or RDS snapshots alone requires more manual intervention for cross-region copying, which increases operational complexity.
Data Lifecycle Manager is more appropriate for managing snapshots and lifecycle policies, but it does not automatically handle cross-region backups.
Question 5:
Scenario: A company needs to store a database username and password securely for an application running on an EC2 instance.

Answer: The correct answer is Create an IAM role with permissions to access the Systems Manager Parameter Store and decrypt the KMS-encrypted parameters.

Explanation:

IAM Role: You create an IAM role for your EC2 instance, which allows the instance to securely access the Systems Manager Parameter Store.
KMS Encryption: The credentials in the Parameter Store are encrypted using KMS. The IAM role should also have permissions to decrypt the parameters.
Trust Relationship is used for defining cross-account access, not needed in this scenario.
Question 6:
Scenario: A company wants to protect a platform against SQL injection and large, sophisticated DDoS attacks.

Answer: The correct answer is AWS Shield Advanced and AWS WAF.

Explanation:

AWS Shield Advanced provides DDoS protection for the network layer and is suitable for mitigating large DDoS attacks targeting your infrastructure.
AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is designed to protect your application from Layer 7 attacks, such as SQL injection, and should be applied to API Gateway.
GuardDuty is a security monitoring service, but it doesn't provide protection against DDoS or SQL injection attacks.
Question 7:
Scenario: A company wants to rewrite a monolithic data-processing application to a microservices architecture using ECS.

Answer: The correct answer is Amazon SQS.

Explanation:

SQS (Simple Queue Service) is used for decoupling the components of a microservices architecture. In this scenario, the application components (producer and consumer) can communicate asynchronously through SQS.
SNS is for publish-subscribe messaging and is not suitable for this scenario where a queue is needed.
Lambda is a serverless compute service and is not used for queue-based communication.
DynamoDB Streams is for tracking changes in DynamoDB tables and is not suitable for messaging between application components.
Question 8:
Scenario: A company wants to migrate a MySQL database to AWS and ensure minimal data loss with transactions stored on at least two nodes.

Answer: The correct answer is RDS MySQL with Multi-AZ deployment.

Explanation:

RDS Multi-AZ provides synchronous replication to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone. In the event of a failure, the standby instance is promoted to master, ensuring high availability and minimal data loss.
Creating RDS with synchronous replication to three nodes would provide more redundancy but is not necessary for the given requirements.
Read Replicas are intended for scaling read workloads, not for disaster recovery or minimizing data loss.
EC2 instances with MySQL are not recommended because RDS provides a fully managed service that simplifies operational tasks like patching and backup.
Question 9:
Scenario: A company is building a dynamic ordering website and wants to minimize server maintenance and patching.

Answer: The correct answer is API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB with on-demand capacity.

Explanation:

API Gateway and Lambda provide a serverless architecture that requires minimal maintenance.
DynamoDB with on-demand capacity automatically scales to handle changes in traffic without manual intervention.
CloudFront provides low-latency content delivery, making this solution highly available and scalable.
Traditional server-based solutions like EC2 with auto-scaling are not suitable for minimizing server maintenance and patching.







Question 1: Lambda function needs access to a database in a private subnet of a company's data center
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
To access the database in the private subnet, you must configure the Lambda function to run inside the VPC. This allows the Lambda to communicate with other resources in the same network (private subnet). It also requires a security group that permits traffic to the database.

Wrong Options:

B: Setting up a VPN connection from AWS to the data center adds complexity and is unnecessary. It would involve routing traffic from Lambda via the VPN, which is not the simplest solution.
C: Updating route tables for all resources in the VPC could expose sensitive data to the on-premises network, which is not desirable for security reasons.
D: Creating an Elastic IP and configuring Lambda to send traffic through it is irrelevant here. You don't need to expose Lambda to the internet or use an Elastic IP.
Question 2: Application using Amazon ECS needs permission to store resized images in Amazon S3
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Create an IAM role with permissions to access S3 and attach it to the ECS task definition. This role will allow the ECS task to perform S3 operations, such as storing resized images.

Wrong Options:

A: Updating the S3 role in IAM is unnecessary since permissions for ECS tasks should be managed by assigning an IAM role to the task itself.
C: Creating a security group for ECS to access S3 is not the correct approach. Security groups control network traffic but do not define access to AWS services like S3.
D: Creating an IAM user for S3 permissions is overcomplicated. You only need to assign a role to the ECS task, not a separate IAM user.
Question 3: Migrating a Windows-based application to AWS with shared file system across multiple Availability Zones
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides a managed, shared Windows file system that supports multi-AZ deployments and can be accessed by EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones.

Wrong Options:

A: EC2 instances with Windows File Server would require manual configuration of a file server, which is not optimal when a managed solution like FSx exists.
C: Amazon EFS is not designed for Windows environments, so it's not a suitable option here.
D: Amazon S3 is an object storage service, not a file system, so it does not work for applications requiring a traditional file system.
Question 4: Highly available solution for e-commerce application with load balanced front-end, container-based application, and relational database
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
ECS with Fargate provides a highly available, fully managed container orchestration service with automatic scaling and minimal operational overhead. It's ideal for containerized applications.

Wrong Options:

A: RDS Multi-AZ provides high availability for databases but does not handle the application or the containerized front-end.
B: RDS with read replicas is useful for read-heavy workloads but does not ensure overall high availability for the entire application.
C: EC2-based Docker cluster requires managing EC2 instances and scaling, which increases complexity.
Question 5: Highly available SFTP solution for uploading files to S3 data lake
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
AWS Transfer Family provides a managed SFTP service that can be used to directly upload files to an S3 data lake, minimizing operational overhead.

Wrong Options:

B: S3 File Gateway is not an ideal solution for SFTP as it’s designed for file-based access to S3 from on-premises storage, not for managing SFTP servers.
C: EC2 instance with SFTP setup involves much more manual configuration and does not reduce operational overhead.
D: Setting up an EC2 instance with a custom SFTP listener is complex and requires more management than using a managed service like AWS Transfer Family.
Question 6: Storing and encrypting contract documents, ensuring no deletion or overwriting for five years
Correct Answer: D
Explanation:
Using S3 Object Lock in Compliance Mode ensures that the documents cannot be deleted or modified. Additionally, with customer-managed keys (CMKs), you have full control over the key rotation policy.

Wrong Options:

A: SSE-S3 (Server-Side Encryption with S3-Managed Keys) automatically handles encryption but does not allow manual control over key rotation.
B: While SSE-KMS (Key Management Service) allows for key management, SSE-KMS by default does not rotate keys automatically every year unless configured, and it does not lock the object from deletion.
C: SSE-S3 doesn't support automatic key rotation or management at the level required in this case.
Question 7: Web application with Java and PHP needs a highly available solution with minimal operational overhead
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a managed PaaS that automates the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of applications. It allows for quick deployment without the need to manage infrastructure.

Wrong Options:

A: S3 bucket is not suitable for hosting a web application, as it is primarily for static website hosting and not dynamic web apps.
C: EC2 instances require manual configuration and management, which contradicts the requirement of minimal operational overhead.
D: Containerizing the web application adds unnecessary complexity when Elastic Beanstalk already offers a simpler, managed solution.
Question 8: RDS MySQL database causing timeouts due to long-running queries for reporting during order processing
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Read replicas of the RDS MySQL database can offload read-heavy workloads, such as reporting queries, from the primary database, allowing it to focus on write operations and improving performance.

Wrong Options:

B: Using Amazon ElastiCache (Memcached or Redis) is not a direct solution for offloading read queries from a database.
C: Route 53 manages DNS, not database load balancing, and is not a solution for handling database read queries.
D: DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and would require a complete application redesign to switch from MySQL.
Question 9: Hospital scanning documents and analyzing them with medical information extraction
Correct Answer: E
Explanation:
The solution involves S3 for storing the documents, AWS Lambda for processing, Amazon Textract for extracting text, and Amazon Comprehend Medical to extract relevant medical information. This combines all the necessary services for a complete workflow.

Wrong Options:

A: Simply storing information in S3 and using Athena does not address the need for medical information extraction.
B: A custom application to extract medical information would be complex and unnecessary. AWS services like Textract and Comprehend Medical are better suited.
C: Using recognition for this task is inappropriate, as it focuses on image-based text extraction and is not suitable for structured document analysis in the medical context.
Question 10: Application with high read traffic needs to reduce load on RDS databases
Correct Answer: A
Explanation:
Using read replicas in Amazon RDS is the best way to offload read traffic from the primary database instance. This reduces the load on the primary instance and ensures better performance.

Wrong Options:

B: ElastiCache is useful for caching but does not directly address high read traffic to RDS databases.
C: Route 53 is used for DNS management, not for handling database read traffic.
D: Using read replicas is simpler than using ElastiCache to manage reads, as the database itself can handle the read scaling.
Question 11: Critical application with EC2 and RDS, requires high availability and automatic failover
Correct Answer: B
Explanation:
RDS Multi-AZ deployments ensure that the database is highly available and can failover automatically in the event of a failure in one Availability Zone. This solution minimizes downtime and ensures that the critical application remains available.

Wrong Options:

A: EC2 instances with a manual failover process would require more management and complexity than RDS Multi-AZ.
C: Read replicas are for scaling read-heavy workloads and do not provide automatic failover for high availability.
D: Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) does not provide automatic failover for databases; it’s for distributing traffic to EC2 instances.








Question 1: Launch EC2 for the Application Database
Detailed Question Explanation:
The company needs to deploy a database on Amazon EC2 instances for high availability. The question asks for the best option to achieve this while ensuring the application database remains highly available and resilient to failures.

Options:
A. Launch two EC2 instances in different availability zones in the same AWS region. Install the database on both EC2 instances and configure these two instances as a cluster set for database replication.

Explanation:
This option is the most appropriate for high availability. By launching EC2 instances in different availability zones, you ensure that if one availability zone fails, the database replication between the two instances allows the application to continue without disruption. This setup provides automatic failover since if one instance becomes unavailable, the other can serve the application without issues.

B. Launch an EC2 instance in an availability zone, install the database on the EC2 instance, and use AMI to backup the data.

Explanation:
While using an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) to back up the database is a good practice, this does not address high availability. The database in a single EC2 instance can fail, and there is no automatic failover. Hence, this setup isn't suitable for high-availability requirements.

C. Launch two EC2 instances, each in different AWS regions. Install the database on both EC2 instances, set up data application failover to a database in a second region.

Explanation:
This option is focused on disaster recovery by setting up a multi-region replication. While this ensures the database can be restored from another region in case of failure, it doesn't provide automatic failover like the multi-AZ setup. Multi-region setups are complex and typically used for disaster recovery rather than high availability. The failover process in this case may take longer and is not automatic.

Question 2: Resilient Solution for Reprocessing Orders
Detailed Question Explanation:
The application processes orders, but if the system fails, orders need to be reprocessed automatically. The goal is to ensure that the system can handle outages and resume processing without manual intervention.

Options:
A. Move the instances into an Auto Scaling group, create an EventBridge rule to target an ECS task.

Explanation:
This approach is too complex for the given requirement. It involves creating an EventBridge rule and integrating ECS tasks, which isn't necessary for automatic order reprocessing. The solution here is much simpler than this.

B. Move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group behind an ELB. Update the order system to send its data.

Explanation:
This option sets up auto-scaling and load balancing, but it does not address automatic reprocessing of orders. The system might handle more traffic, but it doesn't resolve the need for automatic reprocessing after a failure.

C. Move the EC2 instances into an Auto Scaling group, configure the order system to send messages to an SQS queue, and configure the EC2 instances to consume messages from the queue.

Explanation:
This is the correct solution. SQS (Simple Queue Service) ensures that if the order system fails, messages (orders) are not lost. The EC2 instances can then process the messages from the queue once they are back online. This approach provides automatic reprocessing and ensures the application is resilient to outages.

Question 3: Data Management for a DynamoDB Table
Detailed Question Explanation:
The company needs to manage data in DynamoDB efficiently, particularly when it only needs the data from the past 30 days. The goal is to minimize cost and effort while ensuring that outdated data is deleted automatically.

Options:
A. Use a CloudFormation template to deploy the complete solution.

Explanation:
CloudFormation is used for infrastructure as code to deploy AWS resources. While it’s useful for provisioning resources, it’s not the solution needed here. We need a solution to manage data retention in DynamoDB, which CloudFormation alone doesn’t address.

B. Use EC2 instances to run a monitoring application.

Explanation:
This option involves using EC2 instances for monitoring the table, which is an over-complicated solution. DynamoDB has built-in features like TTL (Time to Live) that automatically handle outdated data.

C. Use DynamoDB streams to invoke an AWS Lambda function when a new item is created and configure the Lambda function to delete items older than 30 days.

Explanation:
This option involves using DynamoDB Streams and Lambda to manually manage data deletion. While this could work, it is more complex than necessary. It requires extra configuration and introduces more potential points of failure.

D. Extend the application to add an attribute for the current time plus 30 days for each item, and configure DynamoDB to use this attribute as a TTL (Time to Live).

Explanation:
TTL (Time to Live) in DynamoDB is the most efficient and cost-effective solution. By adding an attribute that tracks the expiration time (30 days from the current time), DynamoDB will automatically delete items once they reach their TTL, without requiring additional infrastructure or manual intervention. This minimizes both cost and development effort.

Question 4: Migrating .NET Application to AWS with Minimal Changes
Detailed Question Explanation:
The company wants to migrate a .NET application to AWS with minimal changes to the existing infrastructure. The solution must ensure high availability while keeping the changes to a minimum.

Options:
A. Refactor the application as serverless with AWS Lambda running .NET Core.

Explanation:
This is a serverless solution, but it requires significant changes to the application code and architecture. The question specifies minimizing changes, so this option is not ideal.

B. Rehost the application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk with the .NET platform as a deployment.

Explanation:
Elastic Beanstalk allows for a lift and shift deployment, which means you can move the .NET application to AWS with minimal changes. Elastic Beanstalk handles the underlying infrastructure, so the application remains unchanged. This is the simplest and most effective solution.

C. Leave the platform as is and run the application on Amazon EC2 using a custom AMI.

Explanation:
While this option works for a lift-and-shift migration, it requires more manual configuration and management compared to Elastic Beanstalk. EC2 instances do not offer the same level of automation as Elastic Beanstalk.

D. Use Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate from Oracle to DynamoDB.

Explanation:
This is incorrect because the application uses Oracle, not DynamoDB. Changing the database would require significant modifications to the application code.

E. Use Database Migration Service (DMS) to migrate from Oracle to Oracle on Amazon RDS in a multi-AZ deployment.

Explanation:
This is a good solution for the database migration. By migrating the Oracle database to Amazon RDS in a multi-AZ deployment, you can ensure high availability with minimal changes to the database.

Question 5: Migrating a Kubernetes Application to AWS
Detailed Question Explanation:
The company runs a containerized application using Kubernetes and wants to migrate to AWS without making code changes. They currently use MongoDB, and the goal is to migrate the application to AWS while minimizing operational overhead.

Options:
A. Use EKS with EC2 worker nodes for compute and DynamoDB for data storage.

Explanation:
This option is not suitable because the application uses MongoDB, not DynamoDB. DynamoDB is not compatible with MongoDB, so this option wouldn’t work for the database storage.

B. Use ECS with EC2 instances for compute and DocumentDB for data storage.

Explanation:
ECS requires significant changes to the application, as it’s different from Kubernetes. Additionally, DocumentDB is the right database (it is AWS’s MongoDB-compatible service), but the application is already using Kubernetes, so ECS would not be the best option.

C. Use EKS with Fargate for compute and DynamoDB for data storage.

Explanation:
Similar to option A, using DynamoDB here doesn’t meet the requirement since the application uses MongoDB. While EKS with Fargate is a good choice for Kubernetes workloads, DynamoDB is not suitable for MongoDB workloads.

D. Use EKS with Fargate for compute and DocumentDB for data storage.

Explanation:
This option is ideal because it keeps the Kubernetes setup (EKS) intact and uses DocumentDB, which is MongoDB-compatible. Fargate removes the need to manage the underlying EC2 instances, thus minimizing operational overhead.





Question 6: Transcription and Analysis of Customer Calls
Detailed Question Explanation:
The company needs a solution to transcribe and analyze customer calls. The goal is to convert speech to text, store the transcriptions, and then analyze them efficiently.

Options:
A. Use Amazon Transcribe with Amazon S3 to store files and Amazon Athena to analyze them.

Explanation:
Amazon Transcribe is a speech-to-text service that can transcribe audio files, such as customer calls, into text. Amazon S3 can be used to store these transcriptions in a highly durable, scalable manner. After storing the transcriptions in S3, Amazon Athena can be used to query the data directly from S3 using SQL, which is perfect for analyzing the transcriptions. This combination offers a fully managed solution that minimizes operational overhead and supports both transcription and analysis in an efficient, cost-effective manner.

B. Use Amazon Transcribe with Amazon S3 for storage and use Amazon Recognition to analyze the files.

Explanation:
While Amazon Transcribe is the correct service for transcription and Amazon S3 is ideal for storage, Amazon Rekognition is designed for image and video analysis, not speech-to-text or text analysis. Thus, it is not appropriate for analyzing transcribed text. This option doesn’t meet the transcription and analysis requirements.

C. Use Amazon Translate to transcribe the audio files.

Explanation:
Amazon Translate is designed for language translation, not for transcribing audio to text. Therefore, this option is incorrect because Amazon Translate cannot perform the transcription function.

D. Use Amazon Lex to transcribe and analyze the audio files.

Explanation:
Amazon Lex is a service designed to build conversational interfaces (like chatbots) and is not built for transcribing audio files. While Lex can analyze conversations, it doesn’t provide transcription capabilities or the necessary storage and analysis features.

Correct Answer: A
Question 7: Access Control for REST API in AWS
Detailed Question Explanation:
The company needs to set up access control for a REST API hosted in AWS. The goal is to authenticate and authorize users to securely access the API.

Options:
A. Send the user’s email address in the header with every request.

Explanation:
While this approach can identify the user, it is not secure. Sending sensitive information like an email address in the header could be intercepted by malicious users, and it does not provide proper authentication or authorization. This is not a scalable or recommended solution.

B. Use API Gateway and Lambda to manage access for each user.

Explanation:
API Gateway and Lambda can be used to build serverless APIs, but this solution would require custom code and complex configuration to handle user authentication and authorization. Although you could manage access this way, it adds unnecessary complexity compared to using a specialized service like Amazon Cognito.

C. Use Amazon Cognito user pool and identity pool to manage user authentication and access.

Explanation:
Amazon Cognito is a fully managed service designed to handle user authentication and access control. It provides a user pool for managing user sign-up and sign-in, and an identity pool for federated authentication, allowing access to AWS resources. This is a serverless solution that minimizes the development effort and integrates well with API Gateway to provide secure access to the REST API. This is the most efficient and secure option for managing API access.

D. Use an API key for each user that must be sent with every request.

Explanation:
Using an API key for each user is a common approach for identifying users, but it is not a secure or scalable solution for authentication and authorization. API keys are easily shared or exposed, making them vulnerable to misuse. This option doesn't provide robust authentication, and managing keys for each user can become cumbersome.

Correct Answer: C
