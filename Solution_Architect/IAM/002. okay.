IAM Basics: 

Users, Policies, Roles, and Groups

Users:

An IAM User represents an individual identity with specific permissions. Each user starts without permissions by default.
Users can log in to the AWS Management Console if given console access and can authenticate programmatically using CLI or API credentials.
You can assign a custom password and, optionally, configure a requirement to change it upon first login.

Policies:

Policies define permissions in JSON format, specifying what actions a user, role, or group can perform on AWS resources.

Two types of policies:

Identity-based policies: Applied to users, roles, or groups to grant them permissions.
Resource-based policies: Attached directly to resources like S3 buckets, providing permissions based on resource ownership.


Types of Identity-based Policies:

AWS Managed Policies: Predefined and maintained by AWS for common permissions.
Customer Managed Policies: Custom policies created by you.
Inline Policies: Attached directly to individual users, roles, or groups, and not reusable.



Roles:

Roles are IAM entities that can be assumed temporarily by a trusted user, application, or service,
enabling temporary access.

Useful in scenarios where an entity outside your AWS account (such as an application or another AWS account) needs access to 
resources without sharing long-term credentials.

Trust Policies: Associated with roles to specify which entities are allowed to assume the role. Often used with AWS services
like Lambda or EC2 to allow specific actions.


Groups:

Groups are collections of users, enabling you to apply policies to multiple users at once.
By placing users in a group, you avoid assigning permissions to each user individually. Changes to group policies
automatically apply to all members.



Authentication Methods in AWS

Console Access: Uses a username and password to log into the AWS Management Console.
Programmatic Access:
AWS CLI: Requires access keys (an access key ID and secret access key) to authenticate.
SDKs and API Access: Enables developers to interact programmatically with AWS resources.
SSH Access: Often used to access EC2 instances.
Certificate-based Access: Used for services requiring additional security layers, such as CodeCommit and CodePipeline.






Policy Types and Structure

Permissions Policies:

Control what actions a user, group, or role can perform.
Defined as JSON documents specifying allowed or denied actions on resources.

Trust Policies:

Associated with roles to determine which entities are allowed to assume the role.
Important for cross-account access and federated access.

Service Control Policies (SCP):

SCPs are used in AWS Organizations to set permission boundaries across multiple AWS accounts.
They restrict permissions that member accounts can delegate, ensuring security governance across the organization.

Permissions Boundaries:

Define the maximum permissions a user or role can have. They do not grant permissions on their own but limit what other policies can allow.




Access Control Models: RBAC and ABAC

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):

Permissions are assigned to roles, and users are given roles to access resources based on job functions.
Example: Assigning administrative permissions to a group of admins through a role with necessary privileges.

ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control):

Policies are defined based on attributes (tags) attached to users and resources.
Example: A policy might allow users to access resources only if their department tag matches the owner tag on the resource.
ABAC can scale well in dynamic environments where attributes change often.




IAM Working Flow with Example

When a user or application (like John) attempts to access an AWS resource (e.g., an S3 bucket), 
the request goes through several steps:

Authentication: IAM checks if the request comes from a valid identity (e.g., a user, role, or federated login).
Authorization: IAM evaluates attached policies to determine if the user has permission to access the requested resource.
Response: If access is allowed, IAM returns a success message (e.g., John can download the object). If denied, it returns a 403 Unauthorized message.



Cross-Account Access and Policies

Cross-Account Access:

AWS enables access to resources across different AWS accounts using roles with specific trust policies.
By configuring roles with permissions that specify which accounts can assume them, cross-account access becomes possible, 
allowing, for example, one account to read from another account’s S3 bucket.

AWS Managed Policies vs. Custom Policies:

Managed policies are a quick way to assign common permissions without manually defining them.
Custom policies can be tailored for precise control over actions on resources.



IAM Management on AWS Console
User Creation:
On the IAM console, you can create users with console or programmatic access.
You can specify custom passwords and manage access keys for programmatic access.


Group and Role Management:

Groups simplify permission management by applying policies at a group level.
Roles can be created with specific trust and permission policies to enable access for AWS services or other accounts.

Policy Attachment:
During user setup, you can attach predefined AWS-managed policies or custom policies to grant required permissions.
You can also directly attach policies to users, groups, or roles, providing granular control over permissions.




AWS IAM User Creation and Permissions
Creating an IAM User:

Go to IAM (Identity and Access Management) in AWS.
Create a new user, selecting permissions settings.
If no permissions are assigned, the user will have no access to AWS services.

Testing User Access:

Log in with the new user credentials.
Attempt to access services like EC2 or S3 without permissions:
The user will see API errors and be unable to view or create resources like S3 buckets due to missing permissions.


Adding Permissions to an IAM User

Granting S3 Read-Only Access:

Return to the admin account in IAM.
Add the "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" policy to the user:
This managed policy is a JSON object defining actions allowed (e.g., listing and reading S3 objects).
The permissions include actions like s3:GetObject and s3:ListBucket across all S3 resources.

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}











In AWS IAM policies, the Resource element is crucial because it specifies which resources a policy applies to.
Different ways to specify resources give you flexibility in controlling permissions at varying levels of granularity, 
from all S3 buckets in an account to specific objects within a single bucket.

Amazon Resource Name (ARN)

1. All Resources
This pattern uses the wildcard * to allow access to all resources.

"Resource": "*"
This is highly permissive and should generally be avoided unless absolutely necessary.

2. All S3 Buckets and Objects
The pattern arn:aws:s3:::* applies the policy to all S3 buckets and objects in the account.

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"

Use this pattern if you want a policy to apply to all S3 resources within an account.

3. Specific Bucket

You can specify a single S3 bucket by using its unique ARN (Amazon Resource Name).

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"

This restricts the policy to only that bucket, without affecting objects inside it.

4. Specific Bucket and All Objects within It

Use this pattern to grant permissions on a bucket and all objects within it.

"Resource": [
  "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",
  "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
]
The /* wildcard includes all objects inside the specified bucket.


5. Specific Objects within a Bucket

You can narrow down permissions to specific objects within a bucket by specifying their paths.

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/specific-folder/specific-object.jpg"

This level of specificity is useful for highly controlled access to individual files.


6. Objects within a Specific Path (Prefix)

You can apply policies to objects that share a common prefix (folder).

"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/specific-folder/*"

This pattern grants access to all objects within a specified folder in the bucket.





Testing Read-Only Access:

Log back into the new user's account and refresh the S3 console.
The user can now see and list all S3 buckets but cannot create or delete them, as they lack those specific permissions.


Resource-Based Policies


Using Resource-Based Policies for Bucket Access Control:

Unlike identity-based policies, resource-based policies attach directly to resources (like S3 buckets).
These policies specify who can access the resource and under what conditions.

Example Scenario:

Attach a resource-based policy to a specific bucket to restrict access by certain users or roles.


Testing Access Control with Resource-Based Policies:

After applying a resource-based policy on an S3 bucket:
The restricted user will not be able to access or view contents in that bucket.
However, they can still access other buckets not covered by this policy.



Roles and Access Permissions


Role Creation for EC2 and Other Services:

Roles are collections of permissions that AWS resources (like EC2) or external users can assume.
Create a role if an EC2 instance needs to interact with other AWS services, like S3 or DynamoDB.
Example: An EC2 instance role with S3 full access and DynamoDB access allows that instance to perform operations on these services.


Configuring Role Trust Policies:

When creating a role, set up a trust policy specifying who can assume it.
Common scenarios include:
Same-account access: Allow resources within the same AWS account to use the role.
Cross-account access: Enable services in another AWS account to assume the role.
Federated access: External users (e.g., Google or Facebook accounts) can assume a role if proper federation is configured.










1. Creating a Role with Permissions

Roles in AWS are used to delegate access to AWS services for both users and AWS services.

Steps for Role Creation:
Navigate to the IAM console and create a new role.
Choose a trusted entity that can assume the role, such as an EC2 instance.
Attach required permissions (like read access for S3 or DynamoDB access).
Name the role and finish the setup.

Attached Permissions: These permissions are attached to the role and define what actions an EC2 instance
or user assuming this role can perform.

Testing the Role: You can test the role by assigning it to an EC2 instance and then performing actions on permitted resources.



2. User Groups and Permissions Management

User Groups: These are collections of IAM users that share a common set of permissions.

Steps to Create and Assign a User Group:

Go to the IAM console and select 'Create Group'.
Add permissions (like S3 bucket access or DynamoDB read access) to the group.
Add users to this group to automatically inherit the permissions.

Benefits of User Groups:
Centralized permission management makes it easy to update permissions for multiple users.
Reduces complexity by applying permissions once at the group level rather than individually.


3. Inline Policies for Specific Permissions

Inline Policies: Custom policies applied directly to a specific user, group, or role, generally
used for unique or restricted permissions.

Steps to Create an Inline Policy:

Select the user or group you wish to add an inline policy to.
Choose ‘Add permissions’ → ‘Create inline policy’.
Use the visual editor or JSON editor to define permissions. 
For example, limit a group’s write access to a specific S3 bucket.

Example Use Case:
A user in a group with read-only S3 access can receive additional inline permissions to write to a specific bucket.



4. AWS CLI Configuration for Access Management

IAM Users & Access Keys: IAM users can access AWS services through the AWS CLI by generating access keys (an access key ID and secret access key).
Steps for CLI Setup:
Create an access key for a user in the IAM console.
Download the access key and configure it in your local environment using the aws configure command.
Set the access key ID, secret access key, default region, and output format.

Profile Management:
Profiles in AWS CLI allow you to switch between multiple sets of credentials.
Example: aws configure --profile <profile-name> creates a new profile.

Accessing Services with CLI:
To interact with AWS resources, use commands such as aws s3 ls.
Specify a profile using the --profile flag, e.g., aws s3 ls --profile <profile-name> if it’s not the default.


5. Trust Policies and STS Tokens

Trust Policy: Defines which entities (like an AWS service or user from another AWS account) can 
assume a role. It’s part of the role definition in IAM.

Security Token Service (STS):
STS is used to generate temporary, limited-privilege credentials for AWS users or services. This is helpful when 
needing to securely access resources without permanent credentials.

Using STS with Roles:

When a user or service assumes a role, they receive an STS token which allows temporary access based on the
permissions of that role.







Configuring AWS CLI Profiles

AWS CLI profiles allow you to store multiple access configurations, each with a unique name. By default, the CLI looks 
for a "default" profile if no profile is specified.

Files involved:

~/.aws/config - Stores profile configurations (region, output format, etc.).
~/.aws/credentials - Stores access keys for each profile.


Steps to Create a Profile:

Manual Entry: Open ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config files to add a profile directly.

[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

[myprofile]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_PROFILE_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_PROFILE_SECRET_KEY

Using CLI Commands: Use aws configure --profile <profile-name> to set up a new profile.

aws configure --profile myprofile

Enter your aws_access_key_id and aws_secret_access_key, along with the preferred region.


Switching Between Profiles:

Use the --profile flag to specify a profile in your CLI commands:

aws s3 ls --profile myprofile
If no profile is specified, the CLI defaults to the "default" profile in your configuration.



Creating and Configuring an EC2 Instance

Launch an EC2 Instance:

Go to EC2 Dashboard > Launch Instance.
Choose Amazon Linux (Free Tier Eligible) and Instance Type (t2.micro for Free Tier).
Key Pair: Create a new key pair or use an existing one for SSH access. 
The key pair file (.pem) is needed for SSH connections.

Configure Security Group for SSH Access:

Allow SSH access by configuring the inbound rule in the security group attached to the instance:
Protocol: SSH (port 22)
Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) if testing, but limit access to your IP for security in production environments.

Connect to the EC2 Instance via SSH:

In your terminal, use the ssh command to connect:

ssh -i "path/to/your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2 Public IP>

If you see a "permissions too open" error, use chmod 400 on the .pem file to restrict permissions:

chmod 400 path/to/your-key.pem

Setting Up IAM Roles and STS for Secure Access

IAM Roles allow EC2 instances to assume permissions temporarily using AWS STS (Security Token Service). 
Here’s how to set up access for your EC2 instance to interact with S3:

Create an IAM Role for EC2

Go to IAM Console > Roles > Create Role.
Select AWS Service > EC2 as the trusted entity.
Attach a Policy (e.g., AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess) to allow access to the S3 bucket.
Name the role (e.g., EC2S3AccessRole) and complete the creation.

b) Assign the IAM Role to the EC2 Instance

Go to EC2 Dashboard > Instances.
Select the instance and choose Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role.
Attach the newly created IAM role (EC2S3AccessRole).

c) Understanding STS for Role-Based Access

When an EC2 instance with an attached IAM role attempts to access an AWS service (like S3), it automatically requests temporary
credentials via AWS STS. Here’s how this works:

STS Assumes the Role: The EC2 instance assumes the attached IAM role (no need for access keys) and requests temporary credentials from STS.

Access Using Temporary Credentials: The EC2 instance can now access the S3 bucket using the temporary
credentials for the duration of the session.

Auto-Renewal of Tokens: AWS automatically renews these temporary credentials, which have a limited validity period,
ensuring continued access as long as the role is attached.

Example Trust Policy for the Role

A trust policy in JSON format grants EC2 the permission to assume the role. Here’s a sample trust policy allowing any EC2
instance within your AWS account to assume the role:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}


Testing Access from EC2 to S3

Once the role is configured, test the connection by listing S3 buckets directly from the EC2 instance:

SSH into your EC2 instance.

Run:

aws s3 ls

This should list all S3 buckets accessible by the IAM role attached to the instance.


5. Managing and Removing EC2 Resources

Once testing is complete, remember to delete resources to avoid incurring costs:

Terminate the EC2 instance: Go to the EC2 Dashboard > Instances, select the instance, and choose Terminate.
Remove Security Groups: If not reusable, delete the security group used for SSH access.
Delete Key Pair: If the key pair isn’t needed, remove it from AWS and delete the .pem file locally.

Configure a new profile:

aws configure --profile <profile-name>

SSH into EC2:
ssh -i "path/to/your-key.pem" ec2-user@<EC2 Public IP>

Change .pem file permissions:

chmod 400 path/to/your-key.pem

List S3 buckets from EC2:

aws s3 ls

This setup should provide you with secure access to AWS services using IAM roles, reducing the need for managing access keys directly on your 
EC2 instance. Let me know if you'd like more details on any specific part!









Creating an IAM Role with S3 Full Access:

Steps:

Select AWS service (e.g., EC2) and go to the next step.
Add the S3FullAccess permission and give the role a name (e.g., S3FullAccessRole).
The Trust Policy defines who can assume the role (e.g., EC2 instances).
The Permission Policy specifies the permissions granted (e.g., full S3 access).

Attaching Role to EC2 Instance:

The role is attached to an EC2 instance by selecting the instance, modifying its security settings, and assigning the newly 
created role (e.g., S3FullAccessRole).
Once the role is attached, the EC2 instance can access S3 resources and perform actions such as listing buckets and uploading objects.


STS (Security Token Service):

Roles are assumed via AWS STS, which allows services (like EC2) or users to temporarily assume roles to access resources.
This is important for cross-service communication, enabling EC2 to access S3 with specific permissions.

Service Control Policies (SCPs):

Usage: SCPs control permissions at the account level within AWS Organizations. They are particularly useful when managing multiple accounts.

Structure:
Root Account: The top-level account in the organization.
Organizational Units (OUs): Group accounts together (e.g., OU1, OU2).
Policies can be applied at the organizational level, propagating restrictions across all accounts in the unit.

Service Control Policy (SCP) Setup:

Creating SCP: To restrict access (e.g., deny S3 write access), create an SCP policy using AWS's editor
or by directly editing the JSON.
Applying the SCP: After creating the SCP, attach it to the relevant organizational unit or root account.
Any account within that unit inherits the restrictions.

Managing AWS Organizations and Accounts:

AWS Organizations allow you to group AWS accounts under a root account.
Accounts can be added by sending invitations to other AWS accounts.
Accounts can be grouped under organizational units (OUs) to apply policies like SCPs.


Important SCP Use Cases:

Restricting specific actions (like S3 access) on certain accounts using SCPs.

Ensuring that permissions are centrally managed and controlled across multiple accounts in AWS Organizations.

This process involves IAM roles, STS for role assumption, and SCPs for managing permissions across AWS accounts, especially
when managing large-scale environments. The combination of these features enables secure, manageable access control across AWS services and resources.





Here are some additional notes on Permission Boundary and SCP (Service Control Policies) in AWS IAM:



Permission Boundary

A Permission Boundary in AWS IAM is a policy that defines the maximum permissions that can be granted to a user. 
It acts as a security control that prevents privilege escalation, meaning users with permission boundaries cannot perform actions 
outside of what is allowed by the boundary, even if they are assigned broader permissions through policies.

Key Points of Permission Boundary:

Prevent Privilege Escalation: Users cannot escalate their privileges by creating users with higher 
privileges than their own.

Attached to Users: A permission boundary is attached to an IAM user, and it restricts the actions that the user can 
take within the limits of that boundary.

Policy Structure: It typically includes a set of policies that limit the IAM actions a user can perform 
(such as creating new users, attaching policies, etc.).

Use Cases: It's useful for managing delegated administrative roles and preventing users from accidentally or 
intentionally escalating their privileges by creating new users with admin permissions.

Example Use Case Without Permission Boundary:

A user (e.g., John) with full IAM access can create new users and assign any policy, such as admin access.
If the new user (e.g., Sandra) has admin access, they can log in and perform actions like accessing EC2, 
even if the original user does not have permission to do so.

Example Use Case With Permission Boundary:

With a permission boundary in place, even if John creates a user like Sandra with admin access, Sandra 
won't be able to access EC2, because the permission boundary prevents the action based on the user's own privileges.

Configuring Permission Boundary:

Create or Attach Permission Boundary: In the AWS Console, when editing a user's policies, you can attach a permission boundary alongside 
their policies. You can either select an existing permission boundary or create a new one.

JSON Policy Example: A sample permission boundary JSON might look like this:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Action": "iam:CreateUser",
            "Resource": "*",
            "Condition": {
                "StringEquals": {
                    "iam:PermissionBoundary": "arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:policy/PermissionBoundary"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}

Service Control Policies (SCPs)

Service Control Policies (SCPs) are part of AWS Organizations and are used to manage permissions across 
accounts within an organization. SCPs act at the organization or organizational unit (OU) level and allow
you to control which AWS services and actions can be used by accounts.

Key Concepts of SCP:

Allow/Deny: SCPs define "Allow" and "Deny" rules for services and actions.
Root Account: SCPs are applied to all accounts in an organization, including the root account, to control access.
Granularity: SCPs can be applied at different levels—either to the root of the organization
or to specific organizational units (OUs).

Example:
You can use an SCP to deny access to certain AWS services like EC2 across all accounts in an organization
or allow certain services for specific OUs, preventing less privileged accounts from using certain AWS resources.

Common Scenarios for Using SCPs and Permission Boundaries:

Managing Privileges Across Multiple AWS Accounts:

SCPs can be used at the organization level to ensure that all accounts in
the organization adhere to the same security policies.
Permission boundaries within accounts prevent users from exceeding their defined permissions.

Delegated Administration:

Using permission boundaries, organizations can delegate administration within accounts without risking privilege escalation.

Enforcing Least Privilege:

SCPs are useful for enforcing the principle of least privilege across an organization, ensuring that users have 
only the permissions they need to perform their tasks.

Differences Between IAM Policies, Permission Boundaries, and SCPs:

IAM Policies: Attach directly to users, groups, or roles and define what actions are allowed or denied on AWS resources.
Permission Boundaries: Limit the scope of IAM policies by defining a maximum boundary of what actions can be performed, 
even if broader permissions are granted.
SCPs: Apply to entire accounts within an AWS organization to control which services and actions can be accessed.

These concepts are crucial for understanding IAM roles and managing access securely in a multi-account AWS environment, 
especially in larger organizations where the least privilege principle and prevention of privilege escalation are important.





1. Creating a Permission Boundary:

Policy Name: When creating the policy, make sure the policy name is exactly the same as the one mentioned in the content,
which should be "permission boundary."

Policy Creation: If an existing policy with the same name already exists, it should be deleted and recreated with the
correct name and content. After creating the policy, you can assign it to the user or role.

2. Setting the Permission Boundary for Users:

User Creation: When creating a new user (e.g., "sender tool"), ensure that you attach the permission boundary to the user.
If the permission boundary is not attached, the user will not be able to perform certain actions (like creating another user) 
as defined in the boundary.

Permissions and Restrictions: The permission boundary acts as a limit on what the user can do. Even if the user inherits 
permissions from another user (like "John"), the boundary restricts them from escalating privileges beyond what the parent user has.

3. Cross-Account Access:

Cross-Account Access Explanation: Cross-account access allows a user in one AWS account to access resources in a different AWS account.

Scenario Example:
Account A (John's Account): John needs access to an S3 bucket in Account B.
Account B (S3 Bucket): Account B must have a role that allows a user from Account A
to assume it and access the S3 bucket.

Steps to Achieve:

In Account A, create a policy that allows the user (John) to assume the role in Account B.
In Account B, create a role that allows trusted users from Account A to assume it. The role also needs 
a permission policy that grants access to the S3 bucket.

4. Practical Steps to Implement Cross-Account Access:

Create a user in Account A (John) with a policy allowing him to assume a role in Account B.
Attach the policy to the user in Account A and ensure it's configured to allow assuming roles.
In Account B, create a role that trusts Account A's users and grants them permissions to access the S3 bucket.
The user in Account A can now assume the role in Account B and access the S3 bucket.





This tutorial is about configuring cross-account access in AWS using roles, along with demonstrating Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 
and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). Here's a breakdown of the steps and concepts discussed:

Cross-Account Access Configuration

Creating Access Keys for CLI Configuration:

In Account A, you need to generate access keys for the AWS CLI. This includes an access key ID and a secret access key.
After generating the key, download the credentials.

Configure AWS CLI:

Open your terminal and configure the AWS CLI by creating a new profile, named John in this case.
You will enter the access key ID, secret access key, and set the default region (e.g., AP-Southeast).
This allows you to use the CLI with specific credentials.

Create Resources in Account B:

In Account B, create an S3 bucket (e.g., mybucket).
Then create an IAM role to allow Account A to assume this role and access the bucket.
The role's trusted policy should trust Account A by selecting "Another AWS account" and providing Account A's ID.
Optionally, configure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or an external ID to improve security.
The permissions policy for the role should grant access to S3 full permissions.

Assume Role from Account A via CLI:

Use the aws sts assume-role command to assume the role from Account B. This requires:
Profile name (John).
Role ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the role created in Account B.
External ID (optional but recommended for security).
This returns temporary security credentials (Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Session Token), which can be exported to environment variables.
Access Resources in Account B:

After assuming the role, use AWS CLI to access S3 bucket in Account B (e.g., aws s3 ls to list the bucket contents).
Once the session is complete, use unset to remove temporary credentials.
Access Control Models: RBAC and ABAC

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):

RBAC assigns permissions based on the user's role within an organization. A user like John could have access to
certain resources (e.g., S3), but not others (e.g., EC2), depending on the policy attached to the role.

In this example, after assigning the S3 Full Access policy to the role, John is able to access and perform 
actions on the S3 buckets but has no access to EC2.

ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control):

ABAC is more dynamic and fine-grained. Access is granted based on attributes (tags) of resources or users.
For example, instead of simply giving full access to a user role, you could give access to resources that have specific tags. 
For instance, a user could be granted access to all EC2 instances with the tag Environment=Dev.

Summary of Key Concepts
STS (Security Token Service) is used for cross-account access, and it provides temporary security credentials.
The External ID is a security mechanism to prevent the confused deputy problem (where an unauthorized entity gains access 
to resources by assuming a role).
Role-based policies can be attached to users or roles, and these policies define what actions can be performed on which resources.
ABAC offers more flexibility than RBAC, allowing for dynamic and attribute-based permissions, while RBAC is simpler but less granular.
This process involves setting up roles, permissions, and temporary access for one account to interact with resources in another account, 
followed by utilizing AWS CLI to verify the access.






Creating a User Group: A group named "demo group" is created. A user (e.g., John) is added to the group.

Creating a Policy: An attribute-based access policy (ABAC) is created, specifying that users with the "group" tag set to "admin" 
can access any S3 bucket. The policy is created using JSON and is designed to restrict access based on a tag attached to the user account.

Attaching the Policy: The policy is attached to the "demo group". No direct permissions are assigned to John, as the 
permissions are inherited from the group.

Testing the Permissions:

Initially, John does not have access to any S3 buckets.
A tag with the key "group" and value "admin" is added to John's user profile.
After refreshing, John gains full access to the S3 buckets.
Modifying the Tag: Changing the tag to "user" instead of "admin" removes John's access to the S3 buckets.

Conclusion: The video explains how ABAC can be used to manage permissions more dynamically, with the ability to customize actions 
and permissions based on user tags.

This method offers flexibility in managing permissions by relying on user-specific attributes instead of static group membership or predefined roles.
