What are IAM Roles?

IAM Roles in AWS provide a way to grant temporary access to AWS resources without using long-term credentials.
Theyâ€™re commonly used for cross-service access, allowing applications, users,
or services to securely access resources.

Role Components
Trust Policy: Defines which entities (AWS accounts, users, services) are allowed to assume the role.
Permissions Policy: Specifies what actions and resources the role can access.

Common Use Cases
Cross-Account Access: Allow users in one AWS account to access resources in another account.
Service Access: Allow an EC2 instance, Lambda function, or other service to interact with S3, DynamoDB, etc., without
embedding credentials.
Federated Users: Grant access to users authenticated outside AWS (e.g., through an external identity provider).

Creating and Assuming a Role
To create a role:
Define its permissions policy.
Set up a trust policy specifying who can assume it.
Assuming a role generates temporary security credentials, which can be used to access 
AWS resources according to the permissions policy.

Best Practices

Least Privilege: Only grant the permissions needed for specific tasks.
Use Roles Instead of Hardcoded Credentials: Avoid embedding access keys in applications.
Monitor Role Use: Use AWS CloudTrail to track role activities.
Regularly Rotate IAM Roles and Policies: Update policies to ensure minimal, up-to-date access.

Security Considerations
MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication): Add MFA to roles where feasible for extra security.
Limited Session Duration: Configure roles with appropriate session durations to limit the window of access.
