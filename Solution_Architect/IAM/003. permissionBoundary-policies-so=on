IAM Permissions Boundaries: 

An advanced IAM feature that defines the maximum permissions available to an IAM entity (user or role).
Limits what an identity-based policy can allow.
Permissions boundaries are attached to users or roles.

Key Concepts:

Identity-Based Policy: Grants permissions directly to a user, group, or role.

Permissions Boundary: Sets the maximum permissions a user/role can have, even if broader permissions are granted by identity-based policies.

If a permission is in the identity-based policy but not in the permissions boundary, the entity cannot perform that action.

Example Scenario:


Joanne's Permissions:
Identity-Based Policy: Developer Policy
Grants full control of: S3, CloudWatch, EC2, IAM

Permissions Boundary:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowSpecificServices",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",            // Full access to S3
                "ec2:*",           // Full access to EC2
                "cloudwatch:*"     // Full access to CloudWatch
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

Allows: S3, CloudWatch, EC2
Excludes:IAM

Result:
Joanne can perform actions in S3, CloudWatch, and EC2.
Joanne cannot perform IAM actions (e.g., creating a user), even though the identity-based policy allows it.


Why Use Permissions Boundaries?

Prevent Privilege Escalation:
Prevents users from creating or assuming roles that grant them more permissions than they should have.

Restrict Over-Permissive Policies:
Helps enforce least privilege by capping permissions.

Privilege Escalation Attack:

Scenario Without Permissions Boundary: Lindsay has IAM Full Access but no permissions boundary.

Lindsay:
Creates a new user (X User).
Assigns Administrator Access policy to X User.
Logs in as X User and performs unauthorized actions, like mining cryptocurrencies.

Result: X User has more permissions than Lindsay herself.

Scenario With Permissions Boundary:

Lindsay still has IAM Full Access.
Permissions Boundary:
Ensures users/roles created by Lindsay have the same or fewer permissions than her.

Lindsay:
Creates X User.
Assigns Administrator Access policy to X User.
Logs in as X User, but X User’s actions are capped by the boundary.

Result: Lindsay cannot escalate privileges.


Benefits of Permissions Boundaries:

Prevent Unauthorized Access: Limits accidental or intentional over-permissive configurations.
Maintain Principle of Least Privilege: Ensures no entity exceeds its required permissions.
Secure Delegated Administration: Allows trusted users to manage permissions safely.

Practical Use Cases:
Delegating Role Creation: Allow certain users to create roles while restricting the permissions these roles can have.
Enforcing Organizational Policies: Limit permissions for specific teams or projects.

AWS IAM Policy Evaluation Logic and Authorization Workflow

1. Initial Decision: Default Deny

All requests are denied by default unless explicitly allowed.
Explicit Deny: Always overrides any Allow, even if the action or resource is otherwise permitted.

2. Policy Evaluation Workflow

AWS uses a structured evaluation workflow to determine whether a request is Allowed or Denied.
Here’s the detailed step-by-step breakdown:

Step 1: Is there an Explicit Deny?

If an explicit deny exists in any policy (identity-based, resource-based, SCP, etc.), the request is immediately denied.

Step 2: Is the Principal part of an AWS Organization?

If the principal's account is within an AWS Organization, check for Service Control Policies (SCPs):
Allow in SCP: Continue evaluation.
No Allow in SCP: Final decision is Deny.

Step 3: Resource-based Policies

If the resource (e.g., S3 bucket) has a Resource-based Policy:
Check for an Allow.
If no Allow is found, proceed to identity-based policy evaluation.

Step 4: Identity-based Policies

Check Identity-based Policies attached to the user, group, or role.
If there is an Allow for the requested action/resource, continue.
If no Allow exists, the decision is Deny (implicit deny).

Step 5: Permissions Boundaries

If a Permissions Boundary is applied to the principal:
Check if the action/resource is allowed within the boundary.
If not allowed by the boundary, the request is denied.

Step 6: Session Policies

If the principal is a Session Principal:
Check for a Session Policy associated with the assumed role.
If no Allow is found, the decision is Deny.


3. Authorization Workflow

Authentication Stage: AWS verifies the identity of the principal(id n pwd probabli) using credentials:

Console Access: Username and password.
Programmatic Access: Access key and secret access key.
Optional: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Request Context

AWS gathers the following information:
Action: API operation the principal wants to perform (e.g., s3:GetObject).
Resources: AWS services or objects being acted upon.
Principal: User, role, or federated identity making the request.
Environment Data: IP address, SSL status, and other contextual data (important for IP-based policies).
Resource Data: Metadata about the target resource.

Policy Evaluation

AWS evaluates all applicable policies:
Identity-based policies.
Resource-based policies.
Permissions boundaries.
SCPs.
Session policies.
Final decision: Allow or Deny.


4. Types of IAM Policies

Identity-based Policies:

Attached to users, groups, or roles.
Define what actions/resources a principal can access.

Example JSON:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}

Resource-based Policies:

Attached to AWS resources like S3 buckets or SNS topics.
Define what actions/resources are allowed for specific principals.
Example JSON:


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": { "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/John" },
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*"
        }
    ]
}

Permissions Boundaries:

Define maximum permissions for users/roles.
Example JSON:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:*",
                "ec2:*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


Service Control Policies (SCPs):

Define maximum permissions for accounts in an organization.

Example JSON:

{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


Session Policies:

Applied during session creation using the AssumeRole API.

Example JSON:


{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "s3:ListBucket",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"
        }
    ]
}



5. Effective Permissions Scenarios

Identity-based Policy + Resource-based Policy
Final permissions are the union of both policies (Allow in either = Allowed).

Identity-based Policy + Permissions Boundary
Final permissions are the intersection of both (Allowed only if in both).

Identity-based Policy + SCP
Final permissions are the intersection of both (Allowed only if in both).


6. Determination Rules

Implicit Deny: All requests are denied unless explicitly allowed.
Explicit Allow: Overrides the implicit deny.
Explicit Deny: Overrides any allow (identity-based or resource-based).
Policies like SCPs, permissions boundaries, and session policies can override allows by imposing implicit denies.


7. Best Practices

Apply least privilege: Only grant permissions necessary for tasks.
Use permissions boundaries and SCPs to restrict permissions effectively.
Combine identity-based policies with resource-based policies for granular control.
Regularly review and refine policies to avoid over-permissioning.

AWS JSON Policies and Utilization in IAM


each aws has its own set of actions that describe tasks you can perfom with that service.
amazon ec2 "Action" : "ec3:RunInstance"
Amazon RDS "Action" : "rds:StopDBInsatnce"



1. Introduction to JSON Policies
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the format AWS uses for writing IAM policies.

Policies define permissions by specifying:
Actions: API operations the policy allows or denies.
Resources: AWS resources the actions apply to.
Effect: Whether the action is allowed or denied.

2. API Actions in AWS

AWS services are composed of API actions:

For example:
Starting an EC2 instance: ec2:RunInstances
Stopping an RDS database: rds:StopDBInstance
Granularity: You can allow/deny:
Specific API actions (e.g., s3:GetObject).
Entire services (e.g., s3:* for all S3 actions).

3. Structure of a JSON Policy

Key Components of a Policy

Version:
Specifies the version of the policy language.

Current: "2012-10-17".

Statement:
A block defining permissions.
A policy can have multiple statements separated by commas.

Effect:
Allow or Deny.

Action:
Specifies the API actions affected by the policy.
Supports wildcards (*) for broader permissions.

Resource:
Specifies the AWS resources the policy applies to.
Uses Amazon Resource Names (ARNs).
Wildcards (*) allow broad application.


4. Example JSON Policy

Here’s a typical policy structure:


{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*",
        "dynamodb:Describe*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*",
        "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/example-table"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Explanation:

Effect: Allow means the policy grants permissions.

Action:
s3:*: Allows all S3 actions.
dynamodb:Describe*: Allows all DynamoDB actions starting with "Describe".

Resource:
arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket: Refers to the specific S3 bucket.
arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/*: Includes objects within the bucket.
arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/example-table: Refers to a specific DynamoDB table.


5. Key Concepts in JSON Policies

Wildcards (*)
Allows broader permissions:
s3:*: All S3 actions.
dynamodb:Describe*: All actions starting with "Describe".
Resource Level Permissions
Resource ARNs specify:
Bucket-level operations: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name.
Object-level operations: arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*.

Multiple Resources
Policies often define multiple resources within the Resource array:
Example: Assigning permissions to both an S3 bucket and its objects.

6. Common AWS JSON Policy Use Cases


Allow All Actions on a Specific S3 Bucket

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-example-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-example-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Restrict to Read-only Access for DynamoDB

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "dynamodb:GetItem",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/my-table"
    }
  ]
}


Deny All S3 Actions

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}


7. Tools for Working with JSON Policies

Policy Editor in AWS Management Console
Provides syntax validation and suggestions.
Highlights formatting issues like missing commas or brackets.
Visual Studio Code
Can be used to write and test JSON policies.
JSON extensions provide formatting assistance.


8. Best Practices

Follow Least Privilege:
Grant only the permissions necessary for tasks.

Validate Policies:
Use AWS Policy Simulator to test policies before applying.

Use Wildcards with Caution:
Avoid overly broad permissions like * unless absolutely necessary.

Document Policies:
Include comments (in documentation) to explain the purpose of each policy.

IAM Policy Simulator

Overview

The IAM Policy Simulator is a powerful AWS tool that enables you to:

Test the effects of policies applied to users, groups, or roles.
Simulate what permissions a principal (user, group, or role) will have without needing to log in as the principal.
View the results of applied policies for specific services and API actions.

Key Features

Simulate for Users, Groups, or Roles:
You can choose to test permissions for a user, group, or role.
Example: Testing Neal (an administrator) or Sara (a read-only user).

Service and Action Selection:
Allows you to select specific AWS services (e.g., EC2, S3) and simulate permissions.
Provides granular control over which API actions to simulate.

View Detailed Results:
Results are displayed for each API action, indicating whether access is Allowed or Denied.

Practical Steps

Open the IAM Policy Simulator:
Log in to your AWS account.
Navigate to the IAM Policy Simulator.

Select Principal:
Choose users, groups, or roles from the left-hand panel.
Example: Select Neal (an administrator).

Choose AWS Service:

On the right-hand side, type and select a service, such as EC2.

Select Actions:
Choose specific actions (e.g., RunInstances) or select all actions for the service.
Example: Simulate all EC2 actions.

Run Simulation:

Click Run Simulation to see which permissions are allowed or denied for the selected principal.

Example Walkthrough

Case 1: User Neal (Administrator)
Setup: Neal has the AdministratorAccess policy attached.
Simulation:
Select the EC2 service and choose all actions.
Run the simulation.
Result:
All actions are Allowed since Neal has unrestricted access through the AdministratorAccess policy.

Case 2: User Sara (EC2 Read-Only)
Create Sara:
Add a new user Sara in IAM.
Enable management console access with an autogenerated password.
Attach the EC2ReadOnlyAccess policy to Sara.

Simulate for Sara:
Select Sara in the policy simulator.
Choose the EC2 service and select all actions.

Run the simulation.
Result:
Denied Actions: API actions that involve modifying resources (e.g., RunInstances, TerminateInstances).
Allowed Actions: Read-only actions such as:
DescribeAddresses
DescribeInstances
DescribeSecurityGroups


Key Benefits of the IAM Policy Simulator

Safe Testing:
No need to log in as the principal to verify permissions.
Prevents unintended changes or risks.

Time-Saving:
Quickly identify whether policies are configured correctly.
Debug complex permission setups without trial and error.

Granular Analysis:
View permissions for specific API actions, making it easier to fine-tune policies.


Best Practices
Use the simulator for policy validation during setup and troubleshooting.
Always verify policies for least privilege to avoid over-permissioning users or roles.
Test complex setups for services with fine-grained permissions (e.g., S3, EC2).
Periodically review and simulate permissions to ensure compliance with organizational security standards.

AWS IAM Access Tools

1. Access Analyzer

Purpose: Evaluates and analyzes access to resources in AWS accounts, providing insights into potentially excessive or insecure permissions.

Key Features:
Public Access Warnings: Flags resources that might allow public access (e.g., S3 buckets).
Detailed Findings: Provides information on access levels granted (read, write, list) and which users or roles have them.
Actionable Alerts: Alerts are given for potentially risky permissions, such as overly broad access that could expose resources.
Create New Analyzers: Allows you to set up new analyzers for monitoring your account's security posture.
Delegated Administrator: Optionally add a delegated administrator to manage findings.


2. Credential Report

Purpose: Provides detailed information about the security status of IAM users and their credentials.

Key Insights:
User Creation Info: Displays user creation dates and their last activity.
Password & MFA Info: Tracks password usage, last change, and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) status.
Useful for Security Auditing: Helps understand how users are set up from a security perspective and whether they meet security requirements like MFA.


3. IAM Policy Simulator (which we learnt before)

Purpose: Allows you to simulate the effects of IAM policies applied to users, roles, or groups to see what permissions are allowed or denied.

How It Works:
Choose a User: Select a user and apply the policy simulation.
Select Service & Actions: Choose specific services (e.g., EC2, S3) and select the desired API actions to simulate.
Run Simulation: Simulate actions (e.g., creating a bucket, deleting an object) to see what is allowed or denied.

Example:
User Jack (with AdministratorAccess) has full access to all actions.
User Chris (with BucketAccess) only has the list permission on S3 and is denied permissions like create bucket or delete object.


4. Role Permissions and Policy Generation

Purpose: Helps you determine and fine-tune permissions for IAM roles based on real activity logs.

How It Works:
Select a Role: Choose a role (e.g., EC2 instance role).
Generate Policies: Use CloudTrail logs to generate a policy based on the actions performed by the role.
Customize Policy: Review the generated policy, add additional permissions, or edit it directly in the JSON editor.
****Use Case: When you need to generate or tighten up permissions for a role based on actual usage.*******

Summary of Tools

Access Analyzer: Scans for public access or overly permissive policies and helps identify security risks.
Credential Report: Tracks the status of IAM users' credentials and MFA configurations for auditing.
IAM Policy Simulator: Simulates the effects of IAM policies to verify what permissions users or roles actually have.
Role Policy Generator: Generates and fine-tunes policies for roles based on CloudTrail logs of recent API actions.
