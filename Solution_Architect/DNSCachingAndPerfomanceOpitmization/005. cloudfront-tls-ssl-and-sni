SSL/TLS and Server Name Indication (SNI) in CloudFront

1. SSL/TLS Certificates in CloudFront

Certificate Issuance:
CloudFront supports SSL/TLS to secure communication between viewers and the CloudFront edge.

Certificates can be:
Issued through ACM (AWS Certificate Manager).
Must be issued in the us-east-1 region, as CloudFront is a global service and requires certificates issued in this region.
Provided by a third-party certificate authority.


*****
If you're using ACM certificates with CloudFront, you must issue the certificate specifically in the us-east-1 region (N. Virginia), regardless of where
your CloudFront distribution serves content.
This is because:
CloudFront centrally manages certificates from us-east-1 for all its edge locations worldwide.
ACM certificates in other regions will not be recognized by CloudFront.
*****

Custom Domain Names:
You can use CNAMES to associate a custom domain name with your CloudFront distribution.

2. Origin SSL/TLS
S3 as Origin:
S3 already has its own built-in SSL/TLS certificate.
HTTPS is supported by default and cannot be modified.

Custom Origins (e.g., ALB, EC2):
Use ACM certificates for ALBs (Application Load Balancers).
For EC2, you can use certificates from ACM or a third-party certificate authority.
Certificates for origins must be public certificates.


3. Protocol Policies
Viewer Protocol Policy:
Governs the communication between viewers and CloudFront.

Options:
Allow HTTP and HTTPS: Supports both protocols.
Redirect to HTTPS: Automatically redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.
HTTPS-only: Forces HTTPS and drops HTTP connections.

Origin Protocol Policy:
Manages communication between CloudFront and the origin.
Can also use HTTPS to secure backend communication.



4. Server Name Indication (SNI)
Purpose:
Allows multiple SSL/TLS certificates for different domain names on a single IP address or listener.
Useful for reducing the cost of additional IP addresses in CloudFront.

How It Works:
A user requests mypublicdomain.com or myotherdomain.com.
The domain name is included in the request header.
CloudFront identifies the corresponding certificate based on the domain name in the header.

Advantages:
Eliminates the need for separate IP addresses or listeners for each domain.
Reduces costs associated with dedicated IPs.

Limitations:
SNI works only with browsers/clients released after 2010.
For older browsers, a dedicated IP is required to ensure compatibility.

Key Points
Use ACM in us-east-1 for CloudFront certificates.
CloudFront allows both viewer and origin communication to be secured via SSL/TLS.
SNI enables cost-effective, multi-domain SSL/TLS support on CloudFront.
Use dedicated IPs only when supporting very old browsers is necessary.
