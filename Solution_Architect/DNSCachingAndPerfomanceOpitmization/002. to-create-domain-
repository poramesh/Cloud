Key Points
Top-Level Domains (TLDs): Options like .com might be more expensive, while .link, .info, or .tech can be cheaper.
Duration & Cost: Domain prices vary based on the TLD and duration (e.g., 1 year vs. multiple years).
Hosted Zone: Automatically set up in Route 53 for DNS configuration when a domain is registered.
WHOIS Privacy: AWS provides WHOIS privacy protection for domains to keep personal contact details hidden.
This process is straightforward and integrates seamlessly into AWS, making Route 53 a great choice for domain registration and DNS management.
