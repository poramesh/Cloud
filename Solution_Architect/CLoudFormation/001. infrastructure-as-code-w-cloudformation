AWS CloudFormation

AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that automates the provisioning and management of AWS resources using template files.
Purpose:
Allows developers to define, deploy, update, and manage AWS infrastructure in a consistent, repeatable way.
Comparison:
Similar to HashiCorp Terraform but designed specifically for AWS.

  
Key Features and Benefits

Declarative Syntax:
Define infrastructure using JSON or YAML templates.
Templates describe resources (e.g., VPCs, Auto Scaling Groups, Elastic Load Balancers).

Automation and Reusability:
Reuse templates across multiple deployments to ensure consistency and reduce human error.

Rollbacks:
Automatically deletes resources when a stack is deleted.
Ensures a clean removal of resources and rollback on deployment failures.

  
  
Core Components of AWS CloudFormation

Template Files:
Define the desired AWS environment in JSON or YAML.
Includes resource configurations, parameters, and conditions.

Stacks:
Represents the entire deployed environment described by a template file.

Lifecycle:
Create: Deploy resources described in the template.
Update: Modify existing resources by supplying an updated template.
Delete: Removes all resources associated with the stack.

Stack Sets:
AWS CF stacksets extends the functionality of staacks by enabling you to create, update, or deelete stacks across 
multiple accounts and regions with a single operation

Change Sets:
Allows previewing of changes to a stack before deployment.
Highlights differences between the deployed infrastructure and the updated template.
Prevents unintended changes by enabling review before implementation.

  
  
Process of Using AWS CloudFormation
Create a Template File:
Define resources and configurations using JSON or YAML.

Deploy a Stack:
Upload the template to CloudFormation.
CloudFormation provisions resources based on the template definition.

Update a Stack:
Modify the template file to include changes or new resources.
Use Change Sets to preview updates before applying them.

Delete a Stack:
Automatically removes all resources created by the stack.



Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
Consistency and Reliability:
Reduces human error by automating resource creation and updates.
Ensures uniformity across deployments.

Simplified Management:
Manage entire infrastructure as a single entity using stacks.

Preview Changes:
Use Change Sets to review and validate changes before implementation.

Multi-Account and Multi-Region Management:
Stack Sets allow centralized management across multiple environments.

HANDS ON LESSON



AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that automates the provisioning and management of AWS resources using templates.

CloudFormation Components:
Stack: A collection of AWS resources managed as a single unit.
Template: A JSON or YAML file that defines the resources and their configurations.
Change Set: A preview of proposed changes to a stack, showing what will be created, updated, or deleted.


Steps to Work with CloudFormation Stacks

1. Create a Stack:
Navigate to AWS CloudFormation in the AWS Management Console.
Choose to create a stack and upload a pre-defined YAML/JSON template.
Provide a stack name and optional parameters.
Submit the stack and monitor the progress in the Events tab.

2. Update a Stack:
Use a Change Set to update an existing stack.
Replace the current template, preview the changes, and execute the change set to apply updates.

3. Delete a Stack:
Deleting a stack removes all associated resources, adhering to any deletion policies defined in the template.



Example Walkthroughs

1. Creating an EC2 Instance with a Security Group

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Create an EC2 instance with a security group for SSH access
Resources:
  InstanceSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Enable SSH access
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
  MyInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0440d3b780d96b29d
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      SecurityGroups:
        - !Ref InstanceSecurityGroup

Template Details:
Defines a security group for SSH access (port 22).
Creates an EC2 instance and attaches the security group.

Key Points:
Security group uses an ingress rule allowing traffic from 0.0.0.0/0 (all IPs).
Update the template with the latest AMI ID before deployment.

Monitoring:
Check the Events tab for progress.
Verify the instance and security group in the EC2 dashboard.

2. Updating the Stack to Add an EBS Volume

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Attach an EBS volume to the EC2 instance, retaining original resources
Resources:
  InstanceSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Enable SSH access
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
  MyInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0440d3b780d96b29d
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      SecurityGroups:
        - !Ref InstanceSecurityGroup
  MyVolume:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Volume
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: !GetAtt MyInstance.AvailabilityZone
      Size: 10
  MyVolumeAttachment:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VolumeAttachment
    Properties:
      InstanceId: !Ref MyInstance
      VolumeId: !Ref MyVolume
      Device: /dev/sdf

Template Updates:
Adds an EBS volume (10 GB) to the EC2 instance.

Process:
Use a Change Set to preview changes before updating the stack.
Ensure the volume's availability zone matches the instance’s zone.

Monitoring:
Verify the volume attachment in the EC2 console under the Storage tab.


3. Updating the Stack to Add an S3 Bucket

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: Add an Amazon S3 bucket to the setup, retaining all previous resources

Resources:
  InstanceSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Enable SSH access
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0

  MyInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      ImageId: ami-0440d3b780d96b29d  # Ensure this AMI ID is valid for your region
      InstanceType: t2.micro
      SecurityGroups:
        - !Ref InstanceSecurityGroup

  MyVolume:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Volume
    Properties:
      AvailabilityZone: !GetAtt MyInstance.AvailabilityZone
      Size: 10

  MyVolumeAttachment:
    Type: AWS::EC2::VolumeAttachment
    Properties:
      InstanceId: !Ref MyInstance
      VolumeId: !Ref MyVolume
      Device: /dev/sdf

  MyS3Bucket:
    Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
    Properties:
      BucketName: my-unique-bucket-name-4rw3dda34  # Ensure this is globally unique

Template Updates:
Adds an S3 bucket for application logging.

Key Points:
Ensure the bucket name is unique (e.g., append random characters).

Process:
Use a Change Set to preview and execute the changes.

Verification:
Check the new bucket in the S3 console.


Important Notes

Template Best Practices:
Use YAML for easier readability.
Reuse and modify existing templates to save time.
Validate templates before deploying.

Intrinsic Functions:
Ref Function: References other resources within the template.
Used for attaching the security group to the EC2 instance and ensuring the EBS volume matches the instance's zone.

Deletion Policies:
Configure deletion policies in the template to retain specific resources (e.g., S3 buckets) after the stack is deleted.

Order of Deletion:
CloudFormation deletes resources in a specific order to ensure dependencies are respected (e.g., volumes are deleted before instances).

Error Handling:
If a resource fails to create or delete, the stack rolls back to its previous state or stops with an error. Review the Events tab for troubleshooting.



Action                 	Key Steps
Create a Stack	        Upload template → Provide stack name → Submit → Monitor progress in Events tab.
Update a Stack	        Use a Change Set → Preview changes → Execute Change Set → Verify updates in the AWS console.
Delete a Stack	        Initiate deletion → Monitor progress in Events tab → Ensure all resources are removed successfully.
Key Intrinsic Functns	  Ref (resource references), Fn::GetAtt (resource attributes).
Template Types	        YAML (preferred for readability) or JSON.
Best Practices	        Validate templates, use the latest AMI, ensure unique S3 bucket names, and configure deletion policies.
