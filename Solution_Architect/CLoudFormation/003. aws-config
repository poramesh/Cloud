AWS Config Service


1. Overview of AWS Config
AWS Config is a service for viewing and managing resource configurations on AWS.
Often used in compliance and governance scenarios to ensure resource configurations align with organizational policies.


2. Benefits of AWS Config

Evaluate Resource Configurations:
Continuously checks if resources align with desired settings.

Snapshot of Current Configuration:
Provides a snapshot of the current state of all resources in your account.

Retrieve Resource Configurations:
Access details of existing and historical resource configurations.

Track Configuration Changes:
Monitors and records changes to resources over time.

Receive Notifications:
Alerts for resource creation, modification, or deletion.

View Resource Relationships:
Visualizes relationships between resources, aiding in dependency management and troubleshooting.


3. AWS Config Workflow

Resource Configuration Evaluation:
AWS Config evaluates configurations against desired rules.

Configuration Recording:
Records all configuration data in Amazon S3.

Notifications:
Sends alerts via SNS topics or CloudWatch Events.

Remediation:
Triggers actions (e.g., Lambda functions, Systems Manager Automation) to remediate non-compliant configurations automatically.


4. Key Features of AWS Config

Rules:
AWS Config uses rules to define desired configurations.
Rules are either AWS Managed or Custom.

Example AWS Managed Rules:
S3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled:
Ensures S3 buckets have server-side encryption enabled.

restricted-ssh:
Verifies that security groups do not allow unrestricted SSH access from the internet.

rds-instance-public-access-check:
Checks if any RDS instances are publicly accessible.

cloudtrail-enabled:
Confirms that AWS CloudTrail is enabled for auditing API actions.

Change Notifications:
Notifications can be configured for any changes to resource configurations.

Historical Configurations:
Stores and provides access to previous resource configurations for auditing or troubleshooting.


5. AWS Config Use Cases
Compliance Monitoring:
Ensures that resources comply with organizational and regulatory policies.

Troubleshooting:
Identifies resource misconfigurations or unauthorized changes.

Automation:
Automatically remediates non-compliant configurations using Systems Manager Automation or Lambda functions.

Auditing:
Tracks historical configurations for investigation and reporting.


6. Key Components in AWS Config Workflow

Resource Data:
Resources send configuration information to AWS Config.

Data Storage:
Configuration data is stored in Amazon S3.

Alerts & Actions:
Use SNS Topics for notifications.
Trigger CloudWatch Events or Lambda functions for reactive actions.

Remediation:
Use Systems Manager Automation for automatic corrections.


AWS Config provides a robust framework for monitoring, evaluating, and maintaining compliance for AWS resources, making it an essential tool for governance,

AWS Config Rule with SSM Automation for Security Group Compliance



Create an AWS Config rule and remediation - removes any SG rules that have 0.0.0.0/0 as a source unless they use TCP port 80
Create an IAM role with a custom trust policy for Systems Manager and add the 'AmazonSSMAutomationRole' policy
Add an inline policy to the role with the JSON from the 'automation-iam-role.json' document
Create a config rule using the 'pc-sg-open-only-to-authorized-ports' managed rule
Add port 80 next to 'authorizedTcpPorts'
Add a remediation rule using the automatic action 'AWS-DisablePublicAccessForSecurityGroup'
For Resource ID parameter specify 'GroupId'
For IpAddressToBlock specify '0.0.0.0/0'
For AutomationAssumeRole specify the ARN of the role created earlier

1. Objective
Create an AWS Config rule to ensure security group rules do not allow unrestricted access to ports other than port 80 (HTTP).
Use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Automation to remediate non-compliant security groups by revoking rules that violate this policy.

2. Steps to Implement

Create IAM Role for SSM Automation:
Navigate to IAM.
Create a role for AWS Systems Manager.
Attach the managed policy "AmazonSSMAutomationRole."

Add an inline policy to allow revocation of security group ingress rules:
Use the JSON policy to define permissions for revoke-security-group-ingress.
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
              "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}


Create AWS Config Rule:

Use the AWS Config console to create a managed rule:
Rule name: VPC-SG-open-only-to-authorized-ports.
Purpose: Ensure only specified TCP ports (e.g., port 80) are open for unrestricted access.

Specify rule parameters:
Authorized TCP ports: 80 (HTTP).
Authorized UDP ports: (Optional, leave empty if not required).

Set Up Remediation with SSM Automation:
In AWS Config, attach a remediation action to the rule:
Use the predefined remediation action: AWS-DisablePublicAccessForSecurityGroup.

Specify:
Resource ID parameter: GroupId.
IP address to block: 0.0.0.0/0.
Automation Assume IAM Role: ARN of the IAM role created earlier.

Test the Rule and Remediation:
Navigate to EC2 > Security Groups.
Identify security groups with unrestricted access to non-authorized ports (e.g., SSH, RDP).
Re-evaluate the rule in AWS Config to identify non-compliant resources.
Manually trigger remediation to remove non-compliant rules.
Verify changes in security group rules.

Remove Temporary Setup (Optional):
After testing, remove the remediation action and delete the Config rule to allow unrestricted configuration changes.


3. Key Components

IAM Role:
Grants Systems Manager permissions to modify security group rules.
Inline policy allows the revoke-security-group-ingress action.

AWS Config Managed Rule:
VPC-SG-open-only-to-authorized-ports ensures only approved ports are open for unrestricted access.

SSM Automation Document:
Remediation action: AWS-DisablePublicAccessForSecurityGroup.
Automatically revokes ingress rules that violate the policy.

Testing and Validation:
Use the AWS Config console to identify and remediate non-compliant resources.
Verify changes in EC2 Security Groups.

4. Outcome
After remediation, security groups only allow unrestricted access on authorized ports (e.g., port 80).
Unauthorized ports (e.g., SSH, RDP) are blocked for unrestricted access.
AWS Config continuously monitors compliance and can trigger SSM automation for remediation.
This setup ensures compliance with organizational security policies while allowing for automatic remediation of violations.







security, and operational efficiency.
