1. RPO (Recovery Point Objective)

Definition: Maximum acceptable amount of data loss after a failure.
Measurement: Seconds, minutes, hours.
Example:
RPO = 2 hours → Backups must occur every 2 hours.
Data loss occurs if a failure happens right before the next backup.
Key Point: Lower RPO = Higher costs (e.g., synchronous replication).

Trade-Off:
Lower RPO (e.g., seconds): Best for critical systems where data loss is unacceptable, such as financial transactions or healthcare systems. However, it is costly.
Higher RPO (e.g., hours): Suitable for less critical systems where occasional data loss is tolerable, like internal reports or non-essential applications.


2. RTO (Recovery Time Objective)

Definition: Maximum time to restore systems after a failure.
Measurement: Seconds, minutes, hours.
Example:
RTO = 4 hours → Systems must be restored within 4 hours.
Key Point: RTO defines how quickly systems can resume operations after a disaster.


3. Timeline Relation

Disaster Occurs → Data loss up to the last backup (RPO).
Time to restore systems = RTO.
Total downtime = RPO + RTO.


4. Techniques for Achieving RPO

Milliseconds/Seconds:
Synchronous Replication: Data is committed only after the second copy is confirmed.
Seconds/Minutes:
Asynchronous Replication: No wait for confirmation; suitable for long distances.
Minutes/Hours:
Snapshots: Periodic backups of EC2, RDS, or on-premises servers.
Hours/Days:
Offsite Backups: Traditional methods like tape storage.


5. Techniques for Achieving RTO

Milliseconds/Seconds:
Fault Tolerance: E.g., mirrored disks for instant failover.
Seconds/Minutes:
High Availability (HA): Load balancing, auto-scaling.
Minutes/Hours:
Automated Recovery: Snapshots and cross-site recovery.
Hours/Days:
Manual Recovery: Old-school on-premises recovery.


6. Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategies

a. Backup and Restore
For: Low-priority workloads.
Process: provision/ Restore systems after events from snapshots (e.g., EBS, RDS).
Cost: Lowest.
RTO: Hours/Days.

b. Pilot Light
For: Moderate-priority workloads.
Process:
Data is replicated across regions.
Minimum resources (e.g., databases, DNS) kept running in the secondary region.(services on/off)
Auto-scaling activates other resources after a disaster.
Cost: Higher than backup/restore.
RTO: Minutes/Hours.

c. Warm Standby
For: Business-critical workloads.
Process:
Like pilot light but with some application instances pre-running in the secondary region.
Faster response to load.
Cost: Higher than pilot light.
RTO: Minutes.

d. Multi-Site Active/Active
For: Mission-critical workloads.
Process:
Active workloads in multiple regions.
Traffic routed to all regions using Route 53.
Databases:
DynamoDB: Supports global tables (multi-master).
Relational Ddatabase Service: Requires manual promotion for failover.
Cost: Highest.
RTO: Near-zero downtime.


7. Summary of DR Strategy Costs & RTO
Backup and Restore: Low cost, high RTO.
Pilot Light: Moderate cost, lower RTO.
Warm Standby: Higher cost, faster RTO.
Multi-Site Active/Active: Highest cost, near-zero RTO.











What is Synchronous Replication?

Synchronous replication ensures that data is written to multiple locations (e.g., primary and secondary storage) simultaneously before 
confirming the write operation as successful.

How it Works:

Data Write Request:
A client sends a request to write data to the primary storage system (e.g., a database or a file system).

Replication to Secondary Storage:
The primary storage system replicates this data to a secondary storage system (e.g., in another availability zone or data center).

Acknowledgment from Secondary:
The secondary storage confirms that it has successfully written the data.

Confirmation to Client:
Once the primary storage receives acknowledgment from the secondary, it sends a confirmation to the client.

This process ensures both locations have identical data at any given moment.

Benefits:

Zero Data Loss:
Since data is written simultaneously to all locations, no data is lost in case of failure of the primary storage.

Consistency:
All copies of the data are always in sync.

Drawbacks:

Latency:
The process requires waiting for the acknowledgment from the secondary storage, which can increase the time it takes to complete a write operation.
Geographical Limitations:
Synchronous replication is typically used within short distances (e.g., within a single region or between nearby data centers) to minimize latency caused by network delays.

Example Use Case:

In Databases:
A banking application requires no data loss.
Transaction data is replicated synchronously to ensure that both the primary and secondary databases have the exact same records.
If the primary database fails, the secondary can take over without losing any data.

In Cloud (e.g., AWS):
Amazon Aurora can replicate data synchronously across multiple availability zones, ensuring fault tolerance within a region.

what is asynchronos replication?

Asynchronous replication is a data replication process where data is written to the primary storage and then sent to secondary storage later without waiting
for confirmation from the secondary system before acknowledging the write operation as complete.

How It Works:
Data Write Request:
A client sends a request to write data to the primary storage system.

Acknowledgment to Client:
The primary storage system immediately acknowledges the write request to the client after completing it on the primary system.

Replication to Secondary Storage:
The data is asynchronously sent to the secondary storage system in the background.

This means there may be a slight delay before the secondary storage is updated with the latest data.

Benefits of Asynchronous Replication:
Low Latency:
Since the primary system doesn't wait for confirmation from the secondary storage, the write operation completes quickly.

Geographical Flexibility:
Asynchronous replication can work over long distances, making it suitable for replicating data across regions or continents.

Cost-Effectiveness:
It requires less bandwidth and network optimization compared to synchronous replication, as it doesn't enforce strict real-time updates.

Drawbacks:
Risk of Data Loss:
If the primary system fails before the data is replicated to the secondary storage, there may be a loss of unreplicated data.

Data Lag:
The secondary storage might not always reflect the most current state of the data. This is known as eventual consistency.

Example Use Cases:
Backup Systems:
Asynchronous replication is commonly used for backups where the secondary system doesn't need to be up-to-date in real time (e.g., disaster recovery setups).

Cross-Region Replication:
In cloud environments like AWS, asynchronous replication is used for cross-region replication (e.g., Amazon S3 Cross-Region Replication) where data is 
replicated between geographically distant regions.

Big Data Applications:
Applications processing large volumes of data may use asynchronous replication to reduce the overhead on the primary system.

Comparison with Synchronous Replication:

Feature	              Synchronous Replication           	Asynchronous Replication
Data Consistency 	    Strong (no lag)	                    Eventual (may lag behind)
Write Latency	        High (waits for acknowledgment)	    Low (no waiting for acknowledgment)
Risk of Data          Loss	None (real-time replication)	Possible (data may not be replicated yet)
Geographical Distance	Short (low latency required)	       Long (can handle high latency)
