Security in the Cloud

1. Managed Microsoft AD (Active Directory)
Fully managed AWS Directory Service.
Best for 500+ users and organizations needing trust relationships.
Can extend schema and connect to on-prem AD.
Requires VPN or Direct Connect (DX) for integration.
Can act as a standalone AD in AWS.

2. AD Connector
Redirects directory requests to on-prem Active Directory.
Best for existing AD setups that need AWS integration.
Comes in two sizes:
Small (up to 500 users).
Large (up to 5000 users).
Requires VPN or DX for connectivity.
Allows EC2 instances to join on-prem AD.
Enables IAM authentication using on-prem AD.

3. Simple AD
Lightweight, low-cost AD-compatible service.
Best for less than 500 users.
Standalone fully managed directory in AWS.
Provides basic AD features:
User and group management.
Group policies.
Kerberos-based SSO.
Supports Linux & Windows EC2 instances.

4. Identity Providers (IDP) & Federation
Allows external user identity management.
Examples: Corporate Directory, Social Logins (Facebook, Google, Amazon).
IAM supports:
OpenID Connect (OIDC).
SAML 2.0.
No need to manage custom authentication systems.

5. IAM Identity Center (Previously AWS SSO)
Centralized access management for multiple AWS accounts.
Manages SSO access and user permissions centrally.
Integrates with business apps (Salesforce, Box, Office 365).
Supports connection to AD or Azure AD.

6. Amazon Cognito
Adds user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to web & mobile apps.
User Pool:
Manages sign-up/sign-in.
Supports social login (Facebook, Google, Amazon).
Uses SAML & OIDC for federated authentication.
Identity Pool:
Provides temporary IAM credentials.
Uses AWS Security Token Service (STS) to assume roles.

7. AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
Managed service for creating, storing, and managing encryption keys.
Supports symmetric & asymmetric encryption.
Key Types:
KMS Keys (Previously Customer Master Keys (CMK)).
Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) for large data encryption.
Key Storage & Management:
AWS-managed KMS keys – Managed by AWS, limited control.
Customer-managed KMS keys – Full control, manual rotation.
AWS-Owned KMS keys – Fully managed by AWS, invisible to users.
Encrypts up to 4KB of data directly.
Use cases:
EBS volume encryption.
S3 encryption.
RDS encryption.

8. AWS CloudHSM
Dedicated hardware security module (HSM) in AWS.
FIPS 140-2 Level 3 compliant.
Single-tenant HSM, provides full key control.
AWS has no access to keys.
Use cases:
SSL/TLS offloading.
Storing private keys for Certificate Authorities (CA).
Oracle Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).

9. AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
Creates, stores, and renews SSL/TLS certificates.
Supports single domain, multi-domain, and wildcard certificates.
Public Certificates:
Signed by AWS Public CA.
Used with CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway.
Private Certificates:
Can create a Private CA (Certificate Authority).
Used for internal applications.

10. AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)
Protects applications from web exploits (SQL Injection, XSS).
Components:
Web ACLs – Attach to CloudFront, ALB, API Gateway.
Rules – Define filtering criteria.
Rule Groups – Reusable rule sets.
IP Sets – Block or allow IP addresses.
Regex Patterns – Define matching rules.
Actions:
Allow.
Block.
Count.

11. AWS Shield
DDoS Protection Service for AWS applications.
Two tiers:
Shield Standard – Free, included with CloudFront.
Shield Advanced – Paid, better protection & response team access.
Provides always-on detection and automatic mitigations.



Key Takeaways
AD Services: Managed Microsoft AD (for enterprises), AD Connector (on-prem integration), Simple AD (cost-effective).
IAM & Federation: IAM Identity Center (SSO), Cognito (app authentication), IDPs (Google, Facebook, SAML).
Encryption: KMS (AWS-managed), CloudHSM (user-controlled, higher security).






Architecture


1. Custom Domain & Encryption in Transit for ALB
Use Route 53 to create an alias record pointing to the ALB's DNS name.
Attach an SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for encryption in transit.

2. Protect EC2 Website Behind ALB from Web Exploits
Use AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF).
Create a Web ACL with rules to block common web exploits (SQL Injection, XSS).
Attach the Web ACL to the ALB.

3. Block Access to ALB from Specific Countries
Use AWS WAF.
Create a Web ACL with a Geo-Match rule to block traffic from specific countries.
Attach the Web ACL to the ALB.

4. Encrypt Large Data Volumes Using KMS
Use Customer Managed Key (CMK) in AWS KMS.
Generate a Data Encryption Key (DEK) using CMK.
Encrypt large volumes of data using the DEK.

5. Mobile App Authentication with Social IDPs & AWS Access
Use Amazon Cognito.
User Pool:
Manages authentication with Social IDPs (Google, Facebook, Amazon).
Provides a preconfigured web UI for login.
Identity Pool:
Grants temporary AWS credentials for authorized access.

6. Join EC2 Instances to On-Prem AD Over Direct Connect
Use AWS AD Connector.
Allows EC2 instances to authenticate with on-premises Microsoft AD.
Requires Direct Connect (DX) or VPN.
