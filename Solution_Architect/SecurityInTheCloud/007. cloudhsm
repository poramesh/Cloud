AWS CloudHSM

A cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that allows you to generate and manage encryption keys securely in AWS.
It is a dedicated hardware device that runs inside your VPC.
Ensures compliance with high-security standards and provides customer-managed control over encryption keys.

Key Features of CloudHSM

Dedicated Hardware:
Unlike KMS (multi-tenant infrastructure), CloudHSM is single-tenant and dedicated to your organization.

FIPS 140-2 Level 3 Compliance:
Uses validated hardware security modules for maximum security (higher compliance level than KMS for certain use cases).

Full Control Over Encryption Keys:
AWS has no visibility into the encryption keys.
You retain complete control of key management and access policies.

Managed Service:
AWS manages the hardware, ensuring automatic scaling and high availability while you manage the keys.

Integration with KMS:
CloudHSM can act as a custom key store for KMS, combining the security of CloudHSM with the service integration of KMS.


Key Use Cases of CloudHSM

Offloading SSL/TLS Processing:
Offloads compute-intensive SSL/TLS operations from web servers, improving performance.

Securing Private Keys for Certificate Authorities (CAs):
Protects private keys for internal or external certificate authorities.

Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):
Stores the master key for transparent data encryption, such as with Oracle databases.

Custom Key Store for KMS:
Provides control over HSM that protects master keys while using KMS for AWS service integrations.

Comparison: AWS CloudHSM vs AWS KMS

Feature	                 AWS CloudHSM                                   	AWS KMS
Tenancy	                 Single-tenant (dedicated hardware).	            Multi-tenant (shared infrastructure).
Control	                 Customer-managed keys and access.	              AWS manages keys and root of trust.
Compliance	             FIPS 140-2 Level 3.	                            FIPS 140-2 Level 2 (and some Level 3).
Third-Party Support	     Broad support for third-party applications.	    Limited third-party support.
AWS Service Integration  Requires KMS custom key store for integration.	  Fully integrated with AWS services.
Availability	           High availability with customer control.	        High availability managed by AWS.


When to Use CloudHSM vs KMS

Choose AWS CloudHSM If:
You require single-tenant, dedicated hardware.
Compliance mandates FIPS 140-2 Level 3 security.
You need full control over encryption keys.
You need to integrate with third-party applications or manage private keys for CAs.

Choose AWS KMS If:
You need easy integration with AWS services.
You prefer a fully managed key management system.
Compliance requirements are satisfied with FIPS 140-2 Level 2/3.

Combine Both:
Use CloudHSM as a custom key store for KMS to retain control over keys while leveraging KMS's integration with AWS services.


Important Notes
Custom Key Store for KMS:
Allows you to use HSM-protected keys with KMS service integrations while retaining full control of the HSM.
Performance:
Offloading SSL/TLS processing improves server performance by leveraging the HSM for compute-intensive cryptographic operations.
Compliance:
CloudHSM is ideal for industries requiring stringent security controls, such as finance, healthcare, and government.
Cost Consideration:
CloudHSM can be more expensive than KMS due to dedicated hardware and additional customer responsibilities.
