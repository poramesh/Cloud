AWS GuardDuty Overview
AWS GuardDuty is an intelligent threat detection service designed to monitor and protect AWS accounts, workloads, and data.
It uses machine learning and threat intelligence to detect potential security threats.

Key Features of GuardDuty

Threat Detection Capabilities:
Detects account compromises.
Monitors EC2 instances for suspicious activity.
Identifies attempts at malicious reconnaissance (e.g., port scanning or probing).
Detects potential S3 bucket compromise.

Continuous Monitoring: GuardDuty analyzes logs from these services:
CloudTrail Management Events: Tracks API activities to detect unusual behavior.
S3 Data Events: Monitors access patterns to detect unauthorized or malicious actions.
VPC Flow Logs: Monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns.
DNS Logs: Identifies suspicious domain queries.


Exam Focus Points

GuardDuty Use Cases:
Identify malicious activities in AWS accounts and workloads.
Detect threats to S3 buckets, EC2 instances, and more.
Enable continuous monitoring for enhanced security requirements.
Integration with Key AWS Services:
GuardDuty works with CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, S3, and DNS Logs for threat analysis.

Service Purpose:
GuardDuty is primarily a security monitoring and detection tool.
It's not a preventative tool (like WAF); instead, it helps detect and alert.
