AWS Directory Service 

AWS Directory Service provides options to implement or connect directory services (like Active Directory or Simple AD) within AWS.
These are used for authentication and authorization of users and resources.

1. AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory (Managed Microsoft AD)
What it is: A fully managed implementation of Microsoft AD running on Windows servers in AWS data centers.
Features:
Highly available domain controllers: Automatically deployed in multiple subnets within a VPC.
Trust relationships: Can connect to on-premises AD via VPN or Direct Connect and establish trust relationships.
Integration: Can connect EC2 instances (Windows/Linux) to the domain.
Azure/Office 365 Integration: Supports synchronization with Azure AD and Office 365 using ADSync and ADFS.
AWS Service Authentication: Works with services like RDS, Amazon FSx, and others for authentication and authorization.

Additional Features:
Group policies
Single Sign-On (SSO) to apps and services
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) using RADIUS

Best Use Case:
For organizations with 5,000+ users or needing trust relationships with on-premises AD.
Supports schema extensions.
Key Fact: Can operate as a standalone Active Directory in AWS.


2. AD Connector
What it is: A proxy to connect an existing on-premises Active Directory to AWS services.
Features:
Integration:
Redirects directory requests to the on-premises AD.
Enables federated sign-ins to AWS applications using AD credentials.
Allows seamless joining of EC2 instances to the on-premises AD domain.

IAM Mapping:
Maps AD credentials to IAM roles for AWS access.
Users can log in to the AWS Management Console using on-premises AD credentials.
Key Facts:
Available in two sizes:
Small: Up to 500 users.
Large: Up to 5,000 users.
Requires VPN or Direct Connect for connectivity.
Best Use Case:
When you want to leverage your existing Active Directory for AWS services without deploying a new directory.


3. Simple AD
What it is: A cost-effective, standalone directory service similar to Active Directory, running in the AWS cloud.
Features:
Management Capabilities:
Manages user accounts and groups.
Supports group policies.
SSO and Kerberos Support:
Provides Kerberos-based single sign-on.
Supports joining Linux and Windows-based EC2 instances.

Key Facts:
Fully managed and standalone.
Best for organizations with fewer than 5,000 users or those that don't need advanced Active Directory features.
Least expensive option.

Best Use Case:
For simple directory requirements and cost-conscious deployments.

Connectivity	  VPN or Direct Connect for trust	VPN or Direct Connect             required	                        N/A
Management	    Fully managed	                                                    Relies on on-premises AD	        Fully managed
Integration support     advanced AD features and schema extensions	                      Maps AD credentials to AWS IAM	  Basic directory capabilities


Conclusion:
Use Managed Microsoft AD for advanced directory needs or large user bases.
Use AD Connector to integrate with an existing on-premises AD.
Use Simple AD for smaller, cost-effective deployments without advanced AD features.















What is Active Directory?
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is primarily used for centralized management
of users, devices, and other resources within a network. It ensures security and organizes access to information across a network.

Key Features of Active Directory

Centralized Management:
AD acts as a single database for managing all user accounts, computers, printers, and other network objects.
Admins can easily control access and apply policies across the organization.

Authentication and Authorization:
Provides login authentication for users and devices.
Manages permissions to access specific resources, like files, applications, or systems.

Directory Organization:
Stores and organizes objects (like users, groups, and devices) in a hierarchical structure.
Includes domains, trees, and forests to logically group resources.

Group Policies:
Allows administrators to define security settings, software installations, and user environment configurations.

Scalability:
Can support small networks to large, multi-site enterprise networks.

Single Sign-On (SSO):
Users log in once and gain access to multiple services without needing to authenticate repeatedly.





Scenario: A Hybrid Organization

The Company Setup:
A mid-sized company, "TechCorp," has:
An on-premises data center with an existing Microsoft Active Directory (AD).
Employees working remotely and using AWS cloud services.
Resources hosted both on-premises and in the AWS cloud (e.g., applications, file shares, and databases).

Challenge:
Employees need seamless access to both on-premises and cloud-hosted applications.
IT admins want to enforce single sign-on (SSO), manage permissions, and ensure secure access.
The company plans to migrate some applications to Amazon EC2 and store files in Amazon FSx (a Windows File Server on AWS).


Solution: AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory
Step 1: Deploy Amazon Managed AD
TechCorp sets up AWS Managed Microsoft AD in their AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud).
This creates highly available domain controllers in multiple AWS availability zones, managed by AWS.

Step 2: Establish Trust Relationships
They establish a trust relationship between their on-premises AD and the AWS Managed AD using a VPN or AWS Direct Connect.
This allows users and devices from the on-premises AD domain to authenticate and access resources hosted on AWS.

Step 3: Joining AWS Resources to AD
Windows-based Amazon EC2 instances (servers) are joined to the AWS Managed AD domain.
Applications on these EC2 instances (e.g., file servers, database apps) can now use domain authentication.

Step 4: SSO for AWS Management Console
Employeesâ€™ credentials from the on-premises AD are mapped to AWS IAM roles through the AWS AD Connector.
Employees can log in to the AWS Management Console or other AWS services with their existing corporate credentials (no need for separate AWS credentials).

Step 5: Secure Access to File Shares
The company deploys Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and integrates it with AWS Managed AD.
Employees can now securely access file shares stored in FSx using their AD credentials, regardless of whether they're working remotely or in the office.

Step 6: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
AWS Managed AD integrates with RADIUS to enforce MFA for secure login. Employees use an MFA app or physical token for additional 
security when accessing AWS resources.




How It Works in Action

Example: Remote Access to Resources

Employee Login:
Sarah, a developer, logs into her laptop using her on-premises AD credentials.
She needs to access a code repository hosted on an EC2 instance in AWS.

Authentication:
Sarah uses SSO to log in to the AWS Management Console using her existing AD credentials.
AWS Managed AD authenticates her request via the trust relationship with the on-premises AD.

Accessing Resources:
Sarah opens the repository hosted on the EC2 instance.
The EC2 instance authenticates her using the AWS Managed AD domain.

Using File Shares:
Sarah needs a shared document stored in Amazon FSx.
She navigates to the file server using a mapped drive, and her credentials are automatically passed for authentication.

Secure App Deployment:
Sarah deploys an application to AWS using AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and access is controlled via IAM roles mapped to her AD user account.
