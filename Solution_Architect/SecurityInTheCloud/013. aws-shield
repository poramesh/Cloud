AWS Shield 

AWS Shield is a managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service designed to safeguard applications hosted on AWS against DDoS attacks.
It ensures protection with always-on detection and inline mitigations to reduce downtime and latency.

Key Features of AWS Shield

Protection Against DDoS Attacks:
Detects and mitigates DDoS attacks aimed at overloading and disrupting resources.
Protects against application-layer (Layer 7) and network-layer (Layer 3/4) attacks.

Always-On Detection:
Continuously monitors traffic to detect unusual patterns.
Mitigates attacks in real-time to minimize service disruptions.

Reduced Downtime and Latency:
Automatically stops attacks before they impact applications.
Ensures a better experience for end users.




AWS Shield Tiers

AWS Shield is available in two tiers:

AWS Shield Standard (Free, included by default):
Protects against common DDoS attacks.
Includes network flow monitoring and basic protections for AWS resources.
Automatically integrated with Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and Route 53.
Provides basic monitoring and protection without additional cost.

AWS Shield Advanced ($3,000/month with a 12-month commitment):
Includes all Standard features plus additional capabilities:
Layer 7 application traffic monitoring (e.g., for application-layer attacks).
Advanced attack detection and mitigation capabilities.
Access to AWS's 24/7 DDoS Response Team (DRT).
Financial reimbursement for costs incurred due to DDoS attacks on Elastic Load Balancers, CloudFront, Route 53, or Global Accelerator.
Detailed attack diagnostics and security posture assessments.



Integration with AWS Services

AWS Shield Standard is enabled by default and integrated with services like:
Amazon CloudFront: Protects web applications behind CloudFront from DDoS attacks.
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): Protects backend resources like EC2 instances.
Route 53: Ensures availability of DNS services during DDoS attacks.



Exam Focus Points

AWS Shield Standard:
Free, enabled by default.
Provides basic monitoring and protection for AWS services against DDoS attacks.
Protects network-layer and some application-layer traffic.

AWS Shield Advanced:
Paid service for enhanced protection against DDoS attacks.
Includes Layer 7 traffic monitoring, 24/7 DDoS Response Team, and cost protection.
Critical use case for organizations requiring advanced security.

AWS Shield vs AWS WAF:
AWS Shield protects against DDoS attacks (floods of data).
AWS WAF blocks application-layer (Layer 7) attacks based on rules like SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).


Key Takeaways
Standard Tier is free, basic, and sufficient for many use cases.
Advanced Tier provides comprehensive security for sensitive and critical applications, but it comes with significant cost.
AWS Shield works closely with CloudFront, WAF, Route 53, and ELB for layered protection.
