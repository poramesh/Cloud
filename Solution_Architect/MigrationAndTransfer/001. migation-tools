AWS Migration Tools 


1. AWS Migration Workflow
Source: On-premises corporate data center with:
Physical servers
Virtual Machines (VMware, Hyper-V)
Databases
File storage (NAS, file servers, etc.)

Connectivity options:
VPN, Direct Connect, or Internet to AWS


2. AWS Migration Tools & Their Functions

Service                                	    Purpose	                                                Destination
AWS Application Discovery Service         	Collects on-premises system information (hostnames,
                                            IPs, MAC addresses, CPU, memory,
                                            network utilization, disk usage)	                       S3, Athena, QuickSight for analytics
AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)	    Migrates servers to EC2                                	 EC2
AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)	      Migrates databases to AWS RDS	                           RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift
AWS DataSync	                              Transfers large amounts of file data	                   S3, EFS, FSx
AWS Migration Hub	                          Centralized monitoring of migrations (AWS tools & 
                                            partner tools)	                                         N/A


3. AWS Application Discovery Service
Collects detailed system metadata from on-premises servers.
Helps in planning migrations.
Data collected:
Hostnames, IPs, MAC addresses
Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)


4. Discovery Methods

Method	                                    Use Case	                       How It Works
Agentless Discovery (Discovery Connector)	  VMware Environments	             Deploy an OVA appliance in vCenter
Agent-based Discovery (Discovery Agent)	    Physical Servers & Hyper-V VMs	 Install agent per server (Windows/Linux)

Agent-based discovery collects more detailed data than agentless discovery.
Data Storage & Analysis:
Can store collected data in S3.
Use Athena and QuickSight for business intelligence & analytics.


Key Takeaways
✅ Application Discovery Service → Collects system metadata before migration.
✅ Application Migration Service (MGN) → Moves servers to EC2.
✅ Database Migration Service (DMS) → Moves databases to RDS.
✅ DataSync → Moves file data to AWS storage services.
✅ Migration Hub → Monitors migration progress centrally.
✅ Discovery Connector (Agentless) for VMware, Discovery Agent (Agent-based) for detailed data.
