AWS Application Discovery Service 


1. Purpose of Application Discovery Service
The starting point for migration planning.
Gathers detailed information about on-premises infrastructure.
Helps in assessing migration requirements.
Supports agent-based and agentless discovery methods.


2. Key Components & How It Works
On-premises Data Center → Application Discovery Service → AWS Migration Hub
Two types of environments:
VMware (Virtual Machines)
Hyper-V / Physical Servers
Collected Data:
Hostnames, IPs, MAC addresses
Disk resource allocation, CPU, RAM, Disk I/O
VM utilization metrics, network I/O, running processes
Performance time series data

3. Discovery Methods
Method	             Type	        Best for	                     Deployment	                          Collected Data
Discovery Connector  Agentless	  VMware Environments            Deploy OVA file in vCenter	          Static config, VM utilization metrics
Discovery Agent	     Agent-based	Physical & Hyper-V Servers	   Install per server (Windows/Linux)	  More detailed data (network I/O, running processes, time-series performance metrics)

Key Exam Tip:
Discovery Connector → Only for VMware.
Discovery Agent → Required for Hyper-V & Physical servers.
If both VMware & Hyper-V/Physical exist, use both Connector & Agent.


4. Storing & Analyzing Data
Data can be stored in Amazon S3.
Can be analyzed using:
Amazon Athena
Amazon QuickSight


5. Deployment Considerations

Factor	          Discovery Connector	           Discovery Agent
Method	          Agentless	                     Agent-based
Where Deployed?	  vCenter (VMware)	             Each physical/Hyper-V server
OS Support	      Any OS in VMware	             Windows, Linux (Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, SUSE, Windows Server)
Collected Data	  Basic config, VM utilization	 Detailed performance & process-level data


6. AWS Console - Discovery Service Setup
Navigate to AWS Management Console → Migration & Transfer → Application Discovery Service.
Discovery Options:
Import data manually (CSV template format)
Discovery Connector (VMware)
Discovery Agent (Physical/Hyper-V)


7. Exam Tips & Key Takeaways
✅ Start with Application Discovery Service to assess migration needs.
✅ VMware? Use Discovery Connector.
✅ Physical/Hyper-V? Use Discovery Agent.
✅ Best practice: Use both methods if there’s a mix of VMware, Hyper-V, and physical servers.
✅ Store data in S3 for further analysis with Athena/QuickSight.
✅ Know the CSV import format for manual data entry.
