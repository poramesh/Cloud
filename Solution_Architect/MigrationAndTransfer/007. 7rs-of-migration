 7 Rs of Migration

The 7 Rs of Migration represent strategies for moving applications and data to the cloud. These strategies range
from the least effort to the most effort. Different sources may refer to this as the 6 Rs or 7 Rs, with the
only difference being a breakdown of one of the strategies into two.


The 7 Rs of Migration

Retire:
The application or system is no longer needed.
It is simply turned off and discarded.

Retain:
The application/system is kept as-is for the time being.
It could be due to factors like depreciating hardware, low priority, or pending future review.

Relocate:
The application or system is moved without modification.
This can be a lift-and-shift scenario, where physical servers or virtual machines are transferred from one data center to another without 
changing anything (e.g., turning off a server, moving it, and powering it back on).

Rehost:
Often called lift-and-shift in AWS terminology.
The operating system (OS) and application are moved to a new host (e.g., on AWS EC2).
This may involve some changes, such as driver updates or OS modifications to support the new host.

Repurchase:
Moving to a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution.
Example: Replacing an on-premises CRM system with Salesforce.
This can involve significant effort in terms of data migration, integration, and potentially restructuring how the system works.

Replatform:
The application is re-platformed to take advantage of cloud features.
Example: Moving an application from on-premises Linux servers with a MySQL database to Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon RDS.
This often requires some refactoring but not as much as refactoring.

Refactor:
The application is redesigned to be cloud-native and utilize serverless and event-driven architectures.
Significant development effort is required.
Example: Migrating traditional architecture to serverless services such as Lambda, DynamoDB, and SQS.
Detailed Focus on the 3 Key Rs for AWS:

Rehost:
AWS recommends using AWS MGN (Application Migration Service) for rehosting.
Involves moving applications from on-premises or virtualized environments (e.g., VMware or Hyper-V) to AWS EC2.
You can perform tests and final synchronization before cutting over.

Replatform:
Example: Migrating to Amazon RDS or Elastic Beanstalk.
Involves moderate development and migration effort.
Tools like Database Migration Service (DMS) and Schema Conversion Tool may be used for database migration.

Refactor:
Focuses on adopting cloud-native, serverless architectures.
Can involve significant development work to migrate traditional applications to serverless and event-driven cloud services (e.g., Lambda, DynamoDB, SQS).
While the operational cost may be low, the development effort and complexity can be high.


Summary
The 7 Rs of Migration represent different approaches to cloud migration, ranging from simple (Retire) to complex (Refactor). AWS particularly 
focuses on Rehost, Replatform, and Refactor for migration strategies, each requiring different levels of development, migration, and effort.
Understanding these strategies will help in determining the most appropriate approach based on the complexity and goals of your migration project.
