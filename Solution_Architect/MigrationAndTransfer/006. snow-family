Snow Family

The Snow Family includes physical devices designed for migrating large volumes of data to AWS. These devices are ruggedized, 
tamper-resistant, and use encryption for secure data transfer. The primary devices in the Snow Family include Snowball, Snowball Edge, SnowCone, and Snowmobile.

Key Devices in the Snow Family

Snowball:
A physical ruggedized device used for moving large data volumes (50-80 TB) quickly when internet links are slow or heavily burdened.
Used for cloud data migration by loading data onto the device and physically transporting it to AWS for upload to Amazon S3.
Uses 256-bit encryption managed by AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

Snowmobile:
A truck with a large container, capable of storing up to 100 petabytes of data (exabyte scale).
Used for massive data transfers that would take too long over the internet, typically when dealing with hundreds of terabytes to petabytes of data.

Snowball Edge:
Optimized for edge computing, supporting both block and object storage and optional GPU.
Used for applications like data collection, machine learning, and processing in environments where internet connectivity is poor (edge locations).
Storage capacity of 100 TB.

SnowCone:
The smallest device in the Snow Family, optimized for edge computing, storage, and data transfer.
Supports offline or online data transfer to services like Amazon S3, EFS, and FSx for Windows File Server.
Lightweight and portable, ideal for remote locations with limited connectivity.



Data Transfer and Optimization

Data Transfer:
Snowball devices use 256-bit encryption for secure storage and transport of data.
The data is transferred using client software installed on local computers that helps with compressing, encrypting, and loading data onto the devices.
Snowball devices support parallel transfers using multiple instances of the Snowball client to increase transfer performance, especially for many small files.

Optimizing Transfer:
Use the latest Mac or Linux Snowball client.
Batch small files together and perform multiple copy operations in parallel.
Transfer directories instead of individual files to optimize speed.

Capacities and Scales
Snowball: 50-80 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowball Edge: 100 TB (petabyte scale).
Snowmobile: Up to 100 petabytes (exabyte scale).



Use Cases
Cloud Data Migration: Moving large data sets to AWS cloud storage.
Content Distribution: Uploading data to the cloud and distributing it to customers.
Tactical Edge Computing: Collecting data at remote locations and processing it on the edge devices.
Machine Learning: Running ML models on Snowball Edge and SnowCone devices at the edge.
Manufacturing: Collecting and processing data in factories, even in locations with poor internet connectivity.
Remote Locations: Data collection, preprocessing, and analysis in remote or temporary sites.



Summary
The AWS Snow Family provides physical devices designed for handling large-scale data migrations, edge computing, and storage needs,
especially in environments with poor internet connectivity. Whether it's Snowball, Snowball Edge, SnowCone, or Snowmobile, these devices
are essential for securely transferring large volumes of data to AWS, while supporting edge computing tasks in remote locations.
