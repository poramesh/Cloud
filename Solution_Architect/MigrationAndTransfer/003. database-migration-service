AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)

1. Purpose of AWS DMS
Migrates databases from various sources to AWS.
Supports homogeneous (same DB type) and heterogeneous (different DB types) migrations.
Can handle on-premises to AWS, cloud-to-cloud, and database consolidation scenarios.
Continuous data replication for disaster recovery and multi-source/multi-target use cases.


2. DMS Migration Scenarios
Source	              Target	                 Migration Type
Oracle	              Amazon Redshift	         Heterogeneous (Needs Schema Conversion Tool - SCT)
MySQL	                Aurora MySQL	           Homogeneous
EC2-hosted DB	        RDS-hosted DB	           Cloud-to-cloud
On-premises Oracle	  RDS Oracle	             Homogeneous
Microsoft SQL Server  RDS SQL Server	         Homogeneous
Multiple DBs	        Single DB Consolidation	 Consolidation

Destinations: Aurora, Redshift, DynamoDB, DocumentDB.
Sources: On-premises, EC2, or RDS-hosted databases.


3. AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
Used for heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle → Redshift).
Converts database schema and code objects (views, stored procedures, functions).


4. Common Use Cases for DMS
✅ On-premises to AWS cloud migrations.
✅ Cloud-to-cloud migrations (EC2 to RDS, RDS to Aurora).
✅ Development & test scenarios (migrating test databases).
✅ Database consolidation (merging multiple databases into one).
✅ Continuous data replication for disaster recovery.
✅ Single-source to multi-target replication (one DB → multiple DBs).
✅ Multi-source to single-target replication (multiple DBs → one DB).


5. Exam Tips & Key Takeaways
✅ Use DMS for database migration (not for storage or app migration).
✅ Homogeneous migration? → No schema conversion needed.
✅ Heterogeneous migration? → Use Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) before DMS.
✅ Supports both full-load & continuous replication.
✅ Can migrate databases running on-prem, EC2, or RDS.
✅ Use cases include cloud migration, DR, and DB consolidation.
