decoupling can be implemented in a traditional server-based application without using AWS services like SQS or Lambda. The core idea of 
decoupling in this context is still to have separate components that communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces,
rather than being tightly bound together. Here's how you can achieve decoupling in a non-AWS (traditional) server application:


Decoupling Techniques in a Traditional Server Application

1. Message Queues (Without AWS) You can use an open-source message queueing system like
RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka to decouple components. 
These message queues allow components of the application to send and receive messages asynchronously without direct dependency on each other.

Example:
In a blog post application, the User Service might submit a message to a message queue when a user signs up, 
and the Notification Service listens to that queue to send a welcome email. 
The User Service doesn’t need to know how the email is sent or even 
if it’s sent successfully—it just sends a message to the queue.

Implementation: 
You would install and configure RabbitMQ or Kafka on your server. Both services support
multiple programming languages, so you can integrate them into your existing application.


2. REST APIs Another way to decouple components is by exposing them via RESTful APIs. Components can communicate with 
each other via HTTP requests, ensuring that they don’t need to share internal logic or states.

Example: 
The Order Service exposes a REST API for order placement. The Inventory Service can call this API to process the order, 
but they don't need to know the details of each other's code.

Implementation:
You would create APIs in each service, and use HTTP clients (like requests in Python, or axios in JavaScript) to call them.
This is a common approach in microservices architectures, where each service has its own responsibilities and API endpoint.



3. Event-driven Architecture (Using Events) You can implement an event-driven architecture where services publish events and subscribe to events. 
An event could be something like "User Created," "Order Placed," or "Payment Processed." Services that need 
to take action upon an event can listen for the event and act on it.

Example:
When a new user signs up, an event like UserCreated is published. The Email Service listens
for this event and sends a welcome email. The User Service doesn't need to know anything
about the email service—it just publishes the event.

Implementation:
You can use tools like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or even Redis as an event bus for this. Services can
publish events to a shared event channel and subscribe to relevant events for processing.



4. Database Decoupling with Eventual Consistency In cases where you have multiple services interacting with the same database, 
you can decouple them by using eventual consistency. Each service maintains its own database (with its own schema) 
and synchronizes with other services via APIs or message queues, reducing the direct coupling of database layers.

Example:
The Order Service maintains its own database of orders. When an order is placed, it sends an event or a message
to the Inventory Service, which updates its own database to reflect the stock level changes.

Implementation:
You would have multiple independent databases for each service, and use APIs or message queues to keep them synchronized.



5. Microservices Architecture Microservices is a common architectural pattern for decoupling applications. Instead
of building a monolithic application where everything is tightly coupled, you break down the application into
smaller services, each with its own responsibility and database.

Example: 
An e-commerce application could have separate services like Order Service, Payment Service, Inventory Service, 
and Shipping Service. Each service is decoupled, and they interact with each other via APIs or message queues.

Implementation: 
Each service is deployed independently (e.g., as Docker containers) and can communicate with other services via HTTP, gRPC, or message queues.




Steps to Achieve Decoupling in a Traditional Server Application

Let's break this down into steps for a basic example using message queues to decouple services.

Step 1: Choose a Message Queue (RabbitMQ Example)

Install RabbitMQ on your server.

On Linux:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
On Windows, download and install RabbitMQ from the official website.

Start RabbitMQ:

sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server

Enable RabbitMQ Management Plugin:
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
You can now access the RabbitMQ management dashboard at http://localhost:15672 (default credentials are guest/guest).


Step 2: Create a Basic Producer Service (Publisher)
A Producer will send messages to RabbitMQ when certain events happen.

import pika
import json

def send_message(order_data):
    # Set up connection
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
    channel = connection.channel()

    # Declare a queue
    channel.queue_declare(queue='order_queue')

    # Send the message
    channel.basic_publish(
        exchange='',
        routing_key='order_queue',
        body=json.dumps(order_data)
    )

    print(f"Sent: {order_data}")
    connection.close()

# Example usage
send_message({"order_id": 123, "customer_id": 456, "product_id": 789})
This Producer will send a message to the order_queue every time a new order is placed.



Step 3: Create a Consumer Service (Subscriber)
A Consumer will listen to the message queue and process the incoming messages.

import pika
import json

def process_order(ch, method, properties, body):
    order_data = json.loads(body)
    print(f"Processing order: {order_data}")
    # Process the order (e.g., update inventory, send email)
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)

def start_consuming():
    # Set up connection
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'))
    channel = connection.channel()

    # Declare the queue
    channel.queue_declare(queue='order_queue')

    # Start consuming messages
    channel.basic_consume(queue='order_queue', on_message_callback=process_order)
    print('Waiting for messages...')
    channel.start_consuming()

start_consuming()

This Consumer listens for messages on the order_queue and processes them as they arrive.


Step 4: Run and Test the System

Run the Consumer in one terminal to start listening for messages.
Run the Producer in another terminal to simulate placing an order.
The Producer sends a message to the queue, and the Consumer processes the message asynchronously.


Other Methods of Decoupling Without AWS
RESTful APIs: You can create an API for each service and let services communicate through HTTP requests.
This is especially useful if you're building microservices.

Webhooks: Webhooks allow one service to notify another service when something happens (e.g., after an order is processed, a webhook
is triggered to update another service).

Database Polling: Services can regularly poll a shared database to check for updates (not ideal for high-throughput systems but can work for small apps).
