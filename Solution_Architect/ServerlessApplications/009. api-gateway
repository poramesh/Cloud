Amazon API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is a service that allows you to create and manage APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for your applications 
running on AWS. These APIs act as a front door to your business logic and applications on AWS. 
It supports:
RESTful APIs (including REST APIs, HTTP APIs)
WebSocket APIs

How API Gateway Works:

API Deployment and Clients:
API Gateway acts as a middle layer between clients (e.g., mobile apps, web apps, or other services) and AWS backend services.
Backend Services: API Gateway connects to services like AWS Lambda, EC2 instances, load balancers, or external services.

Data Flow:
Clients make requests to the API, and API Gateway processes these requests.
API Gateway forwards the requests to the appropriate backend service (e.g., Lambda functions or EC2 instances).
The backend services return responses which API Gateway sends back to the clients.



Deployment Types for APIs:

Edge-Optimized Endpoint:
Reduces latency for global requests by leveraging Amazon CloudFront (a CDN) to cache and serve content from edge locations globally.

Regional Endpoint:
Best suited for services that are primarily in the same region. You can use CDN and web application firewall (WAF) for additional security.

Private Endpoint:
This endpoint is used within a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud). It’s only accessible by services within the VPC or connected via Direct Connect links.


Structure of a REST API:

1. API Gateway connects to a Web App on the internet.
2. Method Request:
Defines allowed HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and maps them to integrations like Lambda, EC2, or other AWS services.
Request Integration: API Gateway can modify the request data (payload) before forwarding it to the backend service.
3. Response:
After receiving a response from the backend, API Gateway can modify the HTTP status codes or transform the response body (e.g., converting it 
to a format suitable for the frontend).



Integration Types:

Lambda Integration:
Proxy Integration: API Gateway passes the request directly to Lambda, and Lambda needs to know how to handle the request data.
Custom Integration: Provides more flexibility, allowing customization of how the request data is processed before sending it to Lambda.

HTTP Endpoint Integration:
HTTP Proxy: Directly forwards the request to an HTTP endpoint without modification.
Custom HTTP Integration: Allows for custom handling of the request before sending it to the HTTP endpoint.

AWS Service Integration:
Typically, these are non-proxy integrations that allow invoking other AWS services.



Caching in API Gateway:

Caching can improve performance by storing responses in a cache, reducing backend calls and lowering latency for repeated requests.
When a request is made, API Gateway first checks the cache. If no cached response exists, it calls the backend and stores the response in the cache.
Cached responses are stored with a Time To Live (TTL).
Caching reduces backend load and improves latency for subsequent requests.



Throttling API Requests:

>>Throttling is used to control the rate of requests to prevent overloading.
Steady State Requests: This is the normal rate of requests, limited to 10,000 requests per second.
Burst Requests: A sudden spike, limited to 5,000 concurrent requests.
If the request count exceeds these limits, API Gateway returns a 429 Too Many Requests error.
>>Per-Method Throttling: You can set specific throttling limits for each method (e.g., GET, POST) or specific API stages.


Usage Plans and API Keys:

Usage Plans allow you to manage access for different users, e.g., Basic and Premium users.
Premium users may have higher throttling limits and better performance.
API Keys are used to identify users and control access based on usage plans:
Requests from different users (e.g., premium or basic) are identified by their API key.
Usage plans can be associated with different API stages, allowing different users to interact with different endpoints.


API Methods:

API methods are similar to HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST, DELETE, PUT).
GET: Retrieves data.
POST: Creates new resources.
PUT: Updates resources.
DELETE: Deletes resources.

These methods can be mapped to different integrations, allowing you to define how data flows between clients and backend services.
Stages in API Gateway:
A stage represents a version or environment of the API (e.g., dev, prod).
Each stage can have its own cache settings, throttling limits, and API deployment.
A stage can be deployed with a cache enabled, reducing latency and backend load.

Summary:
Amazon API Gateway is a powerful service that helps you build and manage APIs for your AWS applications. It supports multiple types of APIs
(REST, HTTP, and WebSocket) and integrates seamlessly with backend services like Lambda, EC2, and other AWS services.



Key features include:
Flexible integration options (Lambda, HTTP, AWS services).
Caching to reduce latency and backend load.
Throttling to manage the rate of requests.
Usage plans and API keys to manage access and pricing for different user tiers.

Creating an HTTP API for a Calculator App:

Steps to Create the Calculator API:

Lambda Function Creation:
Go to the Lambda Console and create a new Lambda function named calculator.
Choose the runtime as Python 3.9.
Once created, delete the default code and paste in the calculator Lambda function code (which handles simple mathematical operations).

import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    operation = event['queryStringParameters']['operation']
    num1 = float(event['queryStringParameters']['num1'])
    num2 = float(event['queryStringParameters']['num2'])
    
    if operation == 'add':
        result = num1 + num2
    elif operation == 'subtract':
        result = num1 - num2
    elif operation == 'multiply':
        result = num1 * num2
    elif operation == 'divide':
        result = num1 / num2
    else:
        return {
            'statusCode': 400,
            'body': json.dumps('Invalid operation')
        }

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps(f"The result is {result}")
    }

Create an HTTP API in API Gateway:
Navigate to API Gateway and select HTTP API as the API type.
Name the API (e.g., CALC API).
Click Next through the setup steps and then Create the API.

Create a Route for the API:
In API Gateway, create a route for the calculator API, using /calculate as the endpoint.
After creating the route, click on it, choose any method, and attach an integration with the Lambda function.

Lambda Integration Setup:
Select Lambda as the integration type.
Choose the previously created Lambda function (calculator).
Allow API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function by granting necessary permissions.

Allow All Methods:
Set up CORS settings to allow all methods and domains by using wildcards (*).

Deploy the API:
Deploy the API to a stage (e.g., prod).
Once deployed, note down the invoke URL of the API.

Create a Static Website (S3 Bucket):
Create a new S3 bucket (e.g., calculator-website).
Upload the index.html (which includes the frontend for the calculator) to the bucket.
Set the S3 bucket to be publicly accessible by modifying the block public access settings.
Enable static website hosting in the S3 bucket's properties, specifying index.html as the index document.

                .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>


Bucket Policy:
Update the bucket policy to allow public access to the files by adding the following permissions:
Action: S3:GetObject
Resource: arn:aws:s3:::<bucket-name>/*

Test the Calculator:
Visit the S3 bucket website endpoint (e.g., http://<bucket-name>.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com).
Test the calculator by performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
Make sure that the API is integrated correctly and responds as expected.

Troubleshooting:

If the app doesn’t work, open browser developer tools to inspect errors.
Check the API Gateway settings, ensure you've deployed the API to the correct stage (prod), and confirm the endpoint URL is correctly specified in
the frontend code (<invoke-url>/prod/calculate).

Clean-Up:
Once done, delete the API, Lambda function, and S3 static website to avoid unnecessary charges.


Key Points:
The Lambda function provides the logic for the calculator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.).
The HTTP API in API Gateway connects to this Lambda function.
CORS settings are important for public access to the API.
The S3 bucket serves as the host for the frontend (index.html) of the calculator app.
Make sure to check permissions, deploy the API to a stage, and verify the invoke URL for successful communication between the frontend and backend.
