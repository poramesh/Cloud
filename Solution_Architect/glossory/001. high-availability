High Availability (HA)
Definition: Ensures minimal service interruption for applications and services. Itâ€™s about keeping services up and running with redundancy.

Key Concepts:
No single point of failure: Design systems to handle failure at any point.
Replicating across multiple Availability Zones (AZs): Spread across geographically separate data centers to ensure continuous service.
Cost-Effective: Typically cheaper than fault tolerance.

Example Services:
>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets in different AZs.
>Auto Scaling: Ensures there are enough instances running.
>Route 53: DNS service, can help with load balancing and failover.



Durability vs. Availability

Durability: Refers to protection against data loss or corruption. AWS S3 offers 11 9's of durability (99.999999999%), meaning data is extremely unlikely to be lost.
Availability: Refers to the uptime and ability to access the data. Services like S3 and EFS provide high durability and you can choose the level of availability.

Key Differences:
High Availability (HA) aims to minimize downtime, while Fault Tolerance aims for zero downtime and data loss.
Durability is about how safe your data is from loss or corruption, while Availability is about the uptime and access to data.
