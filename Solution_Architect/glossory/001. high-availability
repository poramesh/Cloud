High Availability (HA)
Definition: Ensures minimal service interruption for applications and services. Itâ€™s about keeping services up and running with redundancy.

Key Concepts:
No single point of failure: Design systems to handle failure at any point.
Replicating across multiple Availability Zones (AZs): Spread across geographically separate data centers to ensure continuous service.
Cost-Effective: Typically cheaper than fault tolerance.

Example Services:
>Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets in different AZs.
>Auto Scaling: Ensures there are enough instances running.
>Route 53: DNS service, can help with load balancing and failover.
