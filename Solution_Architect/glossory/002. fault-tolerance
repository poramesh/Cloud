Fault Tolerance
Definition: Designed for zero service interruption, even during multiple failures.

Key Concepts:
No downtime or data loss: Needs specialized hardware that can provide instantaneous failover.
Costly: Higher cost than HA due to complex infrastructure.

Example Services:
>RAID 1: Disk mirroring for data redundancy.
>Synchronous DB replication: Guarantees zero data loss by writing data simultaneously to multiple locations.
>Redundant power sources and networking.
