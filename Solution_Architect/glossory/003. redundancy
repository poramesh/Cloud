Redundancy refers to the duplication of critical components or systems to increase reliability and availability. In the context of computing and networking, 
redundancy is used to ensure that a system continues to operate even if one of its parts fails. It is a key principle in building fault-tolerant and highly available systems.
Example: Cloud storage services like Amazon S3 replicate data across multiple data centers for durability and availability.



Data redundancy:

Data redundancy refers to the situation where the same piece of data is stored in multiple locations within a database or storage system. Whil
e redundancy can sometimes be intentional and beneficial (e.g., for backup, fault tolerance, or ensuring high availability), 
it can also lead to inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and increased storage costs when not properly managed.

Types of Data Redundancy

Intentional Data Redundancy:
Used in distributed systems to ensure reliability and availability.
Examples: RAID configurations, database replication, or backups.

Unintentional Data Redundancy:
Occurs due to poor database design, where data is unnecessarily duplicated.
Can result in anomalies during data modification (update, insert, delete).

Advantages of Data Redundancy
Improved Reliability: Helps in recovering data in case of hardware failure.
Faster Data Access: In distributed systems, having copies of data closer to users can reduce access times.

Disadvantages of Data Redundancy
Increased Storage Costs: Requires more storage space.
Data Inconsistency: When changes to one copy of the data are not reflected in other copies, leading to conflicts.
Complex Maintenance: Keeping all copies of the data synchronized requires additional processes and resources.

To manage data redundancy effectively, systems often use techniques like normalization in databases or deduplication in storage systems.
