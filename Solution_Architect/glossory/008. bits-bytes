Example in Text Storage
"A" in ASCII = 1 Byte = 8 bits → Stored as 01000001 in binary.
"Hello" = 5 Bytes = 40 bits → Because each letter is stored as 8 bits.


Bits vs. Bytes in Internet Speeds
Internet speeds are in bits per second (Mbps, Kbps).
Storage sizes are in Bytes (MB, GB, TB).

What is a Bit?
A bit (b) is the smallest unit of data in computing.
It can have only two values: 0 or 1 (binary system).

What is a Byte?
A byte (B) is a group of 8 bits.
It is the standard unit of measuring data storage and memory in computers.

Why 8 Bits in a Byte?
Computers use binary (base-2) system, and early computers used groups of 8 bits to store a single character.
This became the standard size for a byte because:

1 byte can store 256 different values (2⁸ = 256).
This is enough to represent letters, numbers, and symbols (like "A", "B", "1", "@", etc.).
