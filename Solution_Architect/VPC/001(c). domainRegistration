What is a Public IP Address?

Definition: A public IP address is an IP address that is accessible over the internet. It allows devices on the 
internet to communicate with the resource associated with that IP address.

Use in AWS: In AWS, public IP addresses are typically assigned to EC2 instances (Elastic Compute Cloud) or 
other resources that need to be directly accessible from the internet. This allows users to reach
those resources using their public IP addresses.

Key Points About Public IPs in AWS:

Assignment: Public IP addresses can be assigned dynamically or statically.

Dynamic Public IP: Automatically assigned to an instance when it's launched and may change if the instance is stopped and restarted.

Elastic IP: A static public IP address that you can allocate to your AWS account and associate with an instance. This remains the 
same even if you stop or start the instance.

Access: Resources with public IPs can be accessed directly from anywhere on the internet, given the correct security
group settings and permissions.

Usage: Commonly used for hosting websites, APIs, or any service that requires direct internet access.








Overview of Domain Registration and Hosting

Domain Registration:

When you purchase a domain name from a registrar (like Google Domains), you pay a fee for the domain name, which grants
you ownership for a specified period (usually a year).

The registrar provides you with a way to manage DNS settings, including pointing the domain to specific servers.

Pointing the Domain to Your Server:

Once you have your domain, you need to configure its DNS settings to point to your server’s IP address.
In the case of Replit, you would have received a public IP address for your Replit server (or a domain name provided by Replit) and
added this information to your Google Domain DNS settings.

This usually involves creating an A record in your DNS configuration that links your domain (or subdomain) to the server’s IP address.


How This Compares to AWS

If you were to do something similar on AWS, the steps would involve using Route 53 for domain management and EC2 for
hosting, as outlined in the previous response. The key differences are:

Registration: In Google Domains, you register and manage your domain in one place. In AWS, you can do this
using Route 53, which also provides DNS services.

Hosting: Replit likely abstracts away much of the server management, making it easier for users to deploy
applications without needing to configure an instance. In AWS, you would typically launch an EC2 instance
and set up your application there, which can be more complex but also offers more control.


Example Scenario with Google Domains and Replit

Here’s a simplified example of how your previous experience might have looked:

Purchase Domain:

You buy www.example.com from Google Domains.

Get IP Address:

You set up your application on Replit, which gives you a public IP address or a domain to access your application (like replit.com).

DNS Configuration:

In Google Domains, you go to the DNS settings for www.example.com.
You create an A record pointing www.example.com to the IP address you received from Replit.

Access Your Application:

When users enter www.example.com in their browser, they are directed to your application hosted on Replit.
