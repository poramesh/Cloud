AWS Client VPN

AWS Client VPN allows you to securely connect your client computer (Windows, Mac, Linux) to an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) 
via a VPN connection over the internet.

How it Works:

VPC Setup:
In your AWS region, a VPC is set up with several subnets.
A VPN endpoint is created, associated with the subnets.
VPN endpoint’s network interface is provisioned in the subnet for communication with the VPC resources.

Client Computer:

The client computer uses VPN software (e.g., OpenVPN) to establish a VPN connection.
The VPN connection is encrypted (end-to-end) using SSL/TLS on port 443.

Connection Details:

The VPN client performs source network address translation (SNAT), mapping the VPN client’s CIDR block to the VPC's CIDR block.
The route table on the client side will show a route for the VPC CIDR block with a gateway pointing to the VPN endpoint.

Communication:

Once connected, the client can communicate with VPC resources (such as EC2 instances) using private IP addresses.

Encrypted Traffic:

The entire communication over the internet is encrypted, ensuring secure access to resources in your AWS VPC.






AWS Site-to-Site VPN

A Site-to-Site VPN is used to securely connect your on-premises network (e.g., data center, office) to AWS over the internet, 
creating an encrypted tunnel for network traffic.



we got VPC in the aws. the Virtual private gateway(vgw) is attached id deployed on the AWS site. 
and in the route table  we got destination as 192.168.0.0/16 and target is vgw-id.
and at the customer/corporate data center, we got CIDR: 192.168.0.0/16 with the customer gateway id deployed 
on the customer side. 
and then the vpn conencion is establised. which supports static routes or BGP peering/routing

How it Works:

Setup:
A Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) is created on the AWS side, and a Customer Gateway (CGW) is created on the customer’s side.
The CGW is usually deployed in the customer’s on-premises environment (e.g., data center, office).

VPN Connection:
These two components (VGW and CGW) establish an encrypted VPN tunnel over the internet, utilizing IPsec (Internet Protocol Security).

Routing:
Traffic between AWS and the on-premises network is routed using either static routes or BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) for dynamic routing.
The AWS route table is configured to direct traffic to the appropriate destination 
(e.g., customer network CIDR block) via the Virtual Gateway.

Use Case:
The most common use case is connecting an on-premises data center or office to AWS, enabling private communication between
the customer network and AWS resources using private IP addresses.

Backup for Direct Connect:
Site-to-Site VPN can also serve as a backup solution for AWS Direct Connect, which provides a dedicated private connection to AWS.






AWS VPN CloudHub

AWS VPN CloudHub is an architecture pattern used to connect multiple on-premises networks (via Site-to-Site VPN) to a central AWS VPC.

How it Works:

Architecture:

A Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) is deployed on the AWS side.
Multiple on-premises networks (customer offices or data centers) are connected to the AWS VPC via VPN connections.

Hub-and-Spoke Model:
The AWS VPC acts as the hub, and each customer office or data center is a spoke.
Each customer gateway (CGW) uses its own unique BGP Autonomous System Number (ASN) for routing.

customer data cetner 1: customer gateway with ASN: 6500
customer data cetner 2: customer gateway with ASN: 6501


Communication:
Network traffic can be routed between the VPC and the on-premises networks, as well as between the customer
offices/data centers themselves, through the AWS Virtual Gateway.

BGP Routing(border gateway protocol):
BGP is used to advertise routes, and each customer gateway advertises its routes into AWS.
BGP (Border Gateway Protocol): A protocol used for dynamic routing and exchanging routing information between different networks.


IPsec VPN:
The entire setup uses IPsec VPNs to ensure secure communication between all connected locations.








AWS Direct Connect (DX)

AWS Direct Connect (DX) provides a private, high-throughput, low-latency connection from an on-premises 
network directly to AWS, bypassing the public internet.

Differences from VPN:
Unlike VPN (which runs over the public internet), Direct Connect offers dedicated connections for more reliable and stable network performance.
Direct Connect can provide greater bandwidth and lower latency compared to VPN, making it ideal for high-performance applications.


Use Case:

Direct Connect is typically used for enterprise-level connections, where high throughput and low latency are critical.
Direct Connect can also be used in combination with VPN as a backup connection.

MOre on this:

AWS Direct Connect, which is a dedicated network connection between an on-premises data center (or office) and AWS. 
This connection bypasses the public internet to provide private, consistent, and high-performance 
connectivity between your infrastructure and AWS.


AWS Direct Connect Architecture

AWS Direct Connect Locations: These are physical facilities that host network connections between AWS and customer networks. 
AWS has several Direct Connect locations worldwide where customers can establish dedicated network connections.

AWS Cage and Customer Cage: which is inside the location.

AWS Cage: AWS owns a part of the data center (a cage) containing network equipment, 
including the Direct Connect endpoint.
Customer Cage: The customer either installs their own equipment in the cage or partners with an
AWS partner to provide the necessary infrastructure.

Direct Connect Setup:

The customer connects their router to the customer or partner cage at the Direct Connect location.
Cross Connect: A physical cable is used to link the customer’s router to AWS’s network equipment, creating
a direct link to the AWS region where the VPC resides.
Physical Connection: The Direct Connect connection is a fiber-optic line that provides speeds 
from 1 Gbps up to 100 Gbps (depending on location and needs).

Benefits:

Private Connectivity: Unlike public internet connections, Direct Connect establishes a private connection,
increasing security.
Improved Performance: Direct Connect provides lower latency, better bandwidth, and more reliable throughput 
compared to typical internet connections.
Control: You have more control over the network path, meaning you can avoid unpredictable internet routes.
Cost-Effective for Large Data Transfers: While Direct Connect can be expensive, it can be cost-effective 
for transferring large volumes of data to AWS.

Private and Public Virtual Interfaces:

>Private Virtual Interface (VIF): Used to connect to your VPC in the same region. It uses the Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)
to route traffic to your VPC over the Direct Connect link.

>A vif is a virutal interface(802.1Q VLAN)  and a BGP session.

>Public VIF: This allows you to connect to AWS public services (like S3, DynamoDB) across all AWS regions.
However, it does not allow you to access the internet.

>if we got multiple VPC we will create have miltple provate VIFS being used to connect to multiple VPCs in the region.

>VIFS can also be shared with other aws account.

>IPsec VPN over Direct Connect: Direct Connect itself does not encrypt the data. If encryption is required, you can c
create an IPsec VPN over the Direct Connect connection to secure traffic in transit.

>speeds from 50Mbps to 500Mbps can also be accessed via an APN partner.

>100 Gbps is now featuring in select locations,








AWS Direct Connect Gateway
WS Direct Connect Gateway (DX Gateway)
Purpose: AWS Direct Connect (DX) Gateway simplifies connectivity between on-premises environments and AWS VPCs across multiple regions, reducing complexity and cost.

When Not Using Direct Connect Gateway:

Architecture Complexity: When connecting multiple AWS regions to an on-premises office without DX Gateway, each AWS region requires a separate DX connection.

Regional Service Limitation: AWS Direct Connect is regional, meaning multiple DX locations must be used to connect from each region to the corporate office.
Expensive Links: Long-distance links between regions and the corporate office can be costly and complex.
Architecture: Each region connects directly to a DX location close to that region. Separate VPCs and Virtual Private Interfaces (VIFs) are set up for each VPC region connection, requiring more connections.

When Using Direct Connect Gateway:

Centralized Connection: DX Gateway allows a single Direct Connect (DX) connection to multiple VPCs across various AWS regions.

Architecture Simplification: A single connection from the corporate office to a single DX location is used to reach multiple regions.
AWS Global Network Backbone: Data transfers use AWS’s global network backbone for consistent network performance and connectivity across regions.
Routing:

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) handles route advertisement from DX Gateway to VPCs.
Traffic between the DX Gateway and various regions is routed over the AWS network backbone, ensuring efficient and reliable connectivity.
Limitations:

No Regional Traffic Routing: DX Gateway does not support routing traffic between VPCs in different regions. It’s solely for connecting the corporate office to multiple VPCs in different regions.
Use Case: Ideal for global companies that have centralized office locations and want consistent network connectivity to multiple AWS regions using a single DX connection.
