Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.


Core Concepts:

Region: VPCs are created within a specific AWS region and cannot span across multiple regions.


Availability Zones (AZs): Each VPC is associated with multiple AZs, allowing you to create subnets 
in different AZs for redundancy and availability.

Subnets: A subnet is a range of IP addresses within the VPC. Each subnet is tied to a single AZ 
and cannot span multiple AZs. You can create multiple subnets in the same AZ.


INSIDE REGION WE GOT VPC AND INSIDE VPC WE define AZ, INSIDE AVAILABILITY ZONE WE GOT PRIVATE SUBNET AND PUBLIC SUBNET.

you can install EC2 instance in this subnet.


VPC router takes care of routing within vpc and outside of vpc. the route table will make data conenction happen and sent to right place.
if we need internet, it will be attached to the igw.

Example Route Table Entry
Destination	Target	Description
10.0.0.0/16	local	Routes traffic within the VPC
0.0.0.0/0	igw-abc12345	Routes traffic to the Internet Gateway

1. Destination
What It Is: The destination specifies the range of IP addresses (known as a CIDR block) to which traffic should be directed.
Example:
10.0.0.0/16: This means all IP addresses within the range 10.0.x.x will match this route.
0.0.0.0/0: This matches all IP addresses, indicating any traffic going outside the VPC (i.e., to the internet).

2. Target
What It Is: The target specifies where to send the traffic that matches the destination. It could point
to an Internet Gateway (for external access), a NAT Gateway, a peering connection, a local route, or other network resources.
Example:
local: Allows traffic within the VPC to communicate internally without leaving the VPC.
igw-abc12345: An Internet Gateway, used to route traffic from the VPC to the internet.
nat-xyz67890: A NAT Gateway, used to route traffic from private subnets to the internet in a secure way.

Example Scenario
Let’s say you have a VPC with a CIDR block (IP address range) of 10.0.0.0/16. This range allows 65,536 IP addresses in total,
which you can divide into smaller subnets within this VPC. Each subnet you create will be associated with a specific Availability Zone (AZ) in the region.

Steps to Create Subnets

Subnet 1 - Public Subnet:

CIDR Block: 10.0.1.0/24 (provides 256 IP addresses)
Availability Zone: us-east-1a
Purpose: Can be used for public-facing resources, like web servers.
Internet Gateway: This subnet might have an internet gateway attached to allow public access.

Subnet 2 - Private Subnet:

CIDR Block: 10.0.2.0/24 (provides 256 IP addresses)
Availability Zone: us-east-1b
Purpose: Used for private resources, like database servers, which do not need direct internet access.
NAT Gateway: Typically, a NAT gateway is used to provide outbound internet access while keeping it private.

Subnet 3 - Additional Private Subnet:

CIDR Block: 10.0.3.0/24 (provides 256 IP addresses)
Availability Zone: us-east-1a (same AZ as Subnet 1)
Purpose: Additional subnet for internal services, perhaps for scaling up resources in the same AZ.

This subnet includes a total of 256 IP addresses (from 10.0.3.0 to 10.0.3.255), but usable IP addresses
for devices are typically from 10.0.3.1 to 10.0.3.254. IPs are often reserved in the following ways:

10.0.3.0 – Network Address (identifies the subnet itself)
10.0.3.1 – First usable IP (often assigned to the router or gateway)
10.0.3.255 – Broadcast Address (used to communicate with all devices on the subnet)


Key Points
Single AZ per Subnet: Subnet 1 is tied to us-east-1a, and Subnet 2 is tied to us-east-1b. Each subnet can only be 
associated with one AZ, providing isolation in case of an AZ failure.

Multiple Subnets per AZ: You can have multiple subnets within the same AZ (like Subnet 1 and Subnet 3 both in us-east-1a).

Segmentation: By dividing the VPC into subnets, you can manage traffic flow and security separately for public and private resources.

We can create multiple vpc in the same region.

VPC Router: A virtual router that manages the traffic within the VPC. You configure it using
route tables.

Route Tables: Used to define the paths for routing traffic. You specify destinations and targets
for your traffic.

Subnet: A segment of a VPC;s IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.

Internet Gateway: Allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet. There is
only one Internet Gateway per VPC, and it is used for both outbound (egress) and
inbound (ingress) traffic.

Egress-Only Internet Gateway: Used with IPv6 to allow outbound traffic only (no inbound).

NAT Instances/Gateways: Allow instances in a private subnet to access the internet
while preventing inbound traffic from the internet.

NAT Instance: Enables internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets managed (by you).

NAT Gateway: Enables internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets managed (by AWS).

VPC Endpoints: Enable you to connect to AWS services without needing an Internet Gateway or NAT.
(or) Private connection to public AWS services

Peering connections: direct connection between two VPCs

VPN Connections: Allow you to securely connect your on-premises network to your VPC using 
a Virtual Private Gateway and Customer Gateway.

Customer Gateway: Customer side of a VPN connection.

Direct Connect: A service that enables you to establish a dedicated network connection from 
your premises to AWS. it is high speed, high bandwidth. it is a private network conenction.

Security Groups: Act as a virtual firewall for your instances to control inbound and
outbound traffic at the instance level.(instance-level firewall)

Network ACLs: Subnet-level firewalls that control traffic moving in and out of a subnet.
(subnet-level firewall)



VPC IS ANALAGUOS TO HAVING YOUR OWN DATA CENTER INSIDE YOUR AWS CLOUD.
