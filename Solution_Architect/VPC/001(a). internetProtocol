1. IP Address Overview:

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a numerical label assigned to devices connected to a network.
It allows computers to communicate with each other over the internet or a private network.

Class	        IP Range	             Default Subnet Mask	      Total Networks	  Total Hosts per Network
A	     1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255 	   255.0.0.0 or /8	         126	             16,777,214
B	     128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255	   255.255.0.0 or /16	       16,384	           65,534
C	     192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255	   255.255.255.0 or /24	     2,097,152	       254



IP addresses come in two main types:

1. Private IP Address: 

Private IP addresses are used within internal networks like homes, offices, or enterprises, allowing devices to communicate with each other locally
without being exposed to the internet. These IPs are not routable on the public internet, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the
network. Devices on the same private network can communicate with each other using private IPs

Examples of Private IP Usage:

Home Network: Your router may have a private IP like 192.168.1.1, and other devices like laptops or
phones in your home may have IPs like 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3.
Corporate Network: An office could have a private IP range like 10.1.0.0/16, where different departments
have devices with IPs like 10.1.2.15 or 10.1.5.30.

Since these IP addresses are non-routable on the public internet, Network Address Translation (NAT) is used by routers 
to translate private IPs to a public IP when accessing the internet.

Class A Private IP Range:

Range: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
Example: 10.0.1.5
Uses: Typically used in large organizations and enterprises with thousands of devices.

Class B Private IP Range:

Range: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
Example: 172.16.5.20
Uses: Used in medium-sized networks, such as universities and businesses.

Class C Private IP Range:

Range: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
Example: 192.168.1.1
Uses: Commonly used in home networks and small businesses.




2. Public IP Addresses:

Public IP addresses are routable on the internet, meaning they are used by devices to communicate across different 
networks worldwide, including the internet. Every public IP address is globally unique and assigned by Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) or organizations managing the internet's infrastructure.

Public IP Address Example:
Example: 203.0.113.1

Format: Any IP address outside the private ranges (mentioned above) is a public IP.
When a device like your computer or smartphone connects to the internet, it is assigned a public IP address by your ISP. 
This public IP allows devices and servers on the internet to recognize and communicate with your device.

Public IP Address Usage:
Web Servers: A web server hosting a website like example.com has a public IP address so users worldwide can access it.
Home Internet Connection: Your ISP assigns your router a public IP, which allows your home network to communicate with external servers
and services on the internet.

Dynamic vs. Static Public IP:
Dynamic Public IP: Most users have dynamic public IPs, which change periodically and are assigned by ISPs.
Static Public IP: Some businesses and users may opt for a static public IP that remains constant, typically used for hosting servers.

More:
DNS resolution converts domain names into IP addresses.
NAT converts private IP addresses into public IP addresses for devices in 
a local network to communicate over the internet.



MY ipV4 adress of the internt network is 192.168.0.11 whereas the public ip is 82.17.73.93





2. IP Address Structure:


An IP address is represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
This format is divided into four octets (e.g., 192, 168, 0, and 1), separated by dots.
Each octet is 8 bits (binary), with possible values ranging from 0 to 255 in decimal format.


Importance of Structure
Subnetting: Understanding the octets is crucial for subnetting, where parts of an IP address are designated for the network ID and host ID.
Routing: Routers use the octets to determine how to route packets between networks.
Classification: The structure aids in identifying whether an IP address is public or private based on its value.




3. Binary Octets:

Each octet can be converted to binary:
Binary octet: 8-bit binary number (e.g., 192 = 11000000).
The most significant bit (leftmost) carries the highest value (128), and the least significant bit
(rightmost) carries the lowest value (1).

Example conversion:
IP address 192.168.0.1
192 in binary: 11000000 (128 + 64)
168 in binary: 10101000 (128 + 32 + 8)
0 in binary: 00000000
1 in binary: 00000001





4. Domain Name System (DNS):

DNS translates human-readable domain names (e.g., example.com) into IP addresses.
When you type a URL into your browser, your computer contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name to its corresponding IP address.





5. Network and Host Portions of an IP Address:

Network

Definition: A network is a collection of devices (computers, servers, routers, etc.) that are interconnected and can
communicate with each other. The network enables data sharing and resource accessibility among the devices.
Network ID: This part of an IP address identifies the specific network. All devices within the same network share the same network ID.

Host
Definition: A host refers to any device that can be assigned an IP address and can communicate on a network. This 
includes computers, printers, servers, and other devices.
Host ID: This part of an IP address identifies an individual device within a specific network. Each host on the same network must have a unique host ID.

Example
In an IP address like 192.168.1.10:

Network ID: 192.168.1 (indicating that this device belongs to the network defined by the first three octets).
Host ID: 10 (indicating that this is the unique identifier for that specific device within the 192.168.1 network).





6. Subnet Mask:

Subnetting

Subnetting is the practice of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable sub-networks (subnets).
This helps improve network performance and security by controlling traffic and managing IP address allocation.

Purpose
1. Efficient Use of IP Addresses: Subnetting allows for better allocation of IP addresses, minimizing wasted addresses.
2. Improved Security: By segmenting a network, organizations can restrict traffic between subnets and implement 
security policies tailored to each subnet.
3. Enhanced Performance: Smaller subnets reduce broadcast traffic, which can improve overall network efficiency.

How Subnetting Works
Subnet Mask: A subnet mask determines which portion of an IP address is the network ID and which part is the host ID. It's
typically represented in dotted decimal notation (e.g., 255.255.255.0) or CIDR notation (e.g., /24).

For example, in a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 or /24:
The first 24 bits (or three octets) are used for the network ID.
The remaining 8 bits (or one octet) are used for the host ID.

Binary Representation:

IP Address: 192.168.1.10
11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000


Suppose you have the IP address 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0:
Network Address: 192.168.1.0
Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255
Usable Host Range: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254





what is broadcast adresss?

A broadcast address is a special type of IP address that is used to send data to all devices on a specific network simultaneously
Here’s a detailed explanation of what a broadcast address is, how it works, and its significance in networking:

1. Definition
The broadcast address is the highest address in a subnet, where all the bits in the host portion are set to 1.
For example, in a subnet with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the broadcast address would be the last address in that subnet.

2. Example
Subnet: Consider the network 192.168.1.0/24:
Network Address: 192.168.1.0
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Broadcast Address: 192.168.1.255

In this case, 192.168.1.255 is the broadcast address for the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet. This means that if a device on this network sends a 
packet to 192.168.1.255, that packet will be delivered to all devices on the 192.168.1.0 subnet.

3. How It Works
When a device wants to send a message to all devices on the network, it sends a packet addressed to the broadcast address.
Devices on the network will receive the broadcast packet and process it, as they listen for packets sent to the broadcast address.

4. Purpose
Network Discovery: Devices can use broadcast addresses to discover other devices on the same network.
Service Discovery: For example, when a new device connects to the network, it can send a broadcast message to ask
for information about available services.
Sending Messages: Broadcast addresses are used in various protocols and applications, such as ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses.

5. Limitations
Network Traffic: Excessive use of broadcasts can lead to network congestion, as all devices on the network must process broadcast packets.
Security: Broadcast packets can expose devices to unwanted traffic or potential attacks since they reach all devices on the subnet.

6. Types of Broadcasts
Limited Broadcast: Sent to the broadcast address 255.255.255.255, which reaches all devices on the local network segment.
Directed Broadcast: Sent to the broadcast address of a specific subnet (like 192.168.1.255 in the earlier example), 
reaching all devices on that particular subnet.


Summary
The broadcast address plays a crucial role in facilitating communication within a local network by allowing one
device to communicate with all other devices simultaneously. However, it is important to manage and limit broadcasts
to prevent network overload and maintain performance.




Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. 
It was introduced to replace the older system based on classful network design, which had become inefficient due to 
the growing number of networks and limited available IP addresses. Here’s a detailed breakdown of CIDR:

Flexible Subnetting:

CIDR allows the division of IP address spaces into variable-length subnets. This means organizations can allocate IP addresses more 
efficiently according to their needs, rather than being restricted to fixed class boundaries (Class A, B, C).


Notation:

CIDR uses a notation called slash notation. An IP address is followed by a slash and a number, which indicates the number
of bits used for the network prefix.
Example: In 192.168.1.0/24, the /24 indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, and the 
remaining 8 bits are available for host addresses.


Aggregation:

CIDR enables route aggregation (or supernetting), which allows multiple IP networks to be represented by a single IP address prefix. This reduces 
the size of routing tables in routers and improves routing efficiency.

For example, the CIDR block 192.168.0.0/22 encompasses the IP range from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.3.255.

IP Address Efficiency:

CIDR helps mitigate the problem of IP address exhaustion by allowing ISPs and organizations to use address space more efficiently. Instead
of being assigned a whole class of addresses, they can be given just the number they need.

Subnetting Example:

If an organization has a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16, it means the network portion is 16 bits long, leaving 16 bits for host addresses.
This organization can create subnets such as:
10.0.1.0/24 (256 addresses)
10.0.2.0/24 (256 addresses)
Each subnet can host up to 254 devices.




Example Scenario

Suppose an organization, TechCorp, has been assigned the CIDR block 192.168.0.0/24. This means:

Network Address: 192.168.0.0

CIDR Notation: /24 indicates that the first 24 bits are used for the network portion, while the remaining 8 bits are used for host addresses.

Breakdown of the CIDR Block

Subnet Mask:

The CIDR notation /24 corresponds to a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
In binary, the subnet mask would look like this:

11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

The 1s represent the network part, and the 0s represent the host part.

IP Address Range:

The total number of possible addresses for this subnet can be calculated as 2^n. where n is the number of host bits.
n=8 (32 total bits - 24 network bits = 8 host bits)
Total addresses = 2^8 = 256 but only 254 can be assigned to hosts (one address is reserved for the network and one for the broadcast address)

Host IP Range:

Valid host IP addresses for this subnet are from 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.254.

The first address (192.168.0.0) is reserved as the network address, and the last address (192.168.0.255) is reserved as the broadcast address.

Subnetting Example

Now, if TechCorp needs to divide its network into smaller subnets for different departments (e.g., HR, IT, and Marketing), 
it can further subnet the 192.168.0.0/24 into smaller CIDR blocks.

Example of Subnetting

Subnet 1 for HR:
CIDR Block: 192.168.0.0/26
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
Valid IP Range: 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.62
Network Address: 192.168.0.0
Broadcast Address: 192.168.0.63
Total Addresses: 64 (62 usable for hosts)

Subnet 2 for IT:
CIDR Block: 192.168.0.64/26
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
Valid IP Range: 192.168.0.65 to 192.168.0.126
Network Address: 192.168.0.64
Broadcast Address: 192.168.0.127
Total Addresses: 64 (62 usable for hosts)

Subnet 3 for Marketing:

CIDR Block: 192.168.0.128/26
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.192
Valid IP Range: 192.168.0.129 to 192.168.0.190
Network Address: 192.168.0.128
Broadcast Address: 192.168.0.191
Total Addresses: 64 (62 usable for hosts)

Unused Addresses:
The remaining addresses (192.168.0.192 to 192.168.0.255) can be allocated for future expansion or other purposes.
