Public IP Address

A Public IP address is an IP address that is globally unique and routable over the internet.
These addresses are assigned by an internet service provider (ISP) and can be accessed by any
device connected to the internet. They are used to identify devices on the global internet, 
allowing them to communicate with other public IP addresses.

Key Points:
>Publicly Routable: Public IPs are accessible over the internet.
>Uniqueness: Each public IP must be unique across the internet.
>Assigned by ISPs: They are typically assigned by your ISP and are limited in number because they 
are allocated and regulated by organizations like IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).

Examples of Public IP:
8.8.8.8 (Google's DNS server)
54.239.28.85 (an example AWS public IP)

Cost and Availability:
>Public IP addresses are considered scarce resources, especially IPv4 addresses 
(due to the limited number of available IPv4 addresses).
>They may be purchased or leased from ISPs and cloud providers like AWS, and there could b
e associated costs (e.g., Elastic IPs in AWS have costs if not in use).
>Subnetting and Private IP Assignment
Yes, subnetting involves assigning private IP addresses within an internal network (like a corporate
LAN or a VPC in the cloud). Subnetting helps divide a large IP network into smaller segments 
or subnets, each with its own range of IP addresses.

Private IP Addresses:

Private IPs are used within private networks and cannot be routed on the public internet. Devices with private IPs
can communicate within the same private network but need a device like a router or a NAT (Network Address Translation)
gateway to communicate with the public internet.
The ranges of private IP addresses fall within Class A, Class B, and Class C networks.

How Subnetting Works with Private IP Addresses:

When you create a private network, for example, a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) on AWS or a local corporate LAN, you typically:

Choose a CIDR block: This determines the overall range of IP addresses that your network will use. 
For example, 10.0.0.0/16 means you're using a Class A private IP range, where IP addresses
will span from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255.

Divide the network into subnets: Using subnetting, you split the larger network into smaller subnetworks.
Each subnet gets a subset of the available IP addresses. For example:

10.0.1.0/24 for one subnet.
10.0.2.0/24 for another subnet.

Assign private IP addresses: Devices within the subnets (e.g., EC2 instances, routers, etc.) 
get assigned private IP addresses from the available range within their respective subnet. These IPs are used for internal communication.

Example of Subnetting:

Let’s say you have a VPC with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16:

You might create three subnets:
Public Subnet: 10.0.1.0/24 (256 addresses) -----> MORE EXAPLANATIO BELOW
Private Subnet 1: 10.0.2.0/24 (256 addresses)
Private Subnet 2: 10.0.3.0/24 (256 addresses)

In this setup, the subnetting allows you to assign private IP addresses to the devices in each subnet, 
but none of these private IP addresses can be directly accessed from the internet
without some intermediary (like NAT or a public IP).

Private IP Assignment with Subnetting:

A private IP (such as 10.0.1.10) is typically assigned dynamically using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) 
or manually (static assignment).
Each subnet has a unique range of IP addresses defined by its CIDR block, and devices within the subnet get IPs from this range.

Summary
Public IPs are globally routable on the internet, unique, and assigned by ISPs or cloud providers.
Private IPs are used within private networks and can't be routed on the public internet.
Subnetting is a way of dividing a larger network into smaller sub-networks and involves
assigning private IP addresses within each subnet to internal devices.


Public Subnet with Private IP Addresses:


Even though a public subnet allows communication with the internet, the IP addresses assigned within the subnet
are still private IP addresses. This is because:

Private IP Addresses are used within the VPC for internal communication between resources (e.g., EC2 instances, databases, etc.).

A public subnet simply means that instances (like EC2 instances) within this subnet can access the internet directly,
but they are still assigned private IP addresses within the VPC's CIDR range (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24).

For example:
The public subnet might be 10.0.1.0/24, and an instance within this subnet could have a private IP like 10.0.1.5.

Why Public Subnets Use Private IP Addresses?

Internal Communication:
The private IP addresses (e.g., 10.0.1.5) allow communication between resources within the VPC. 
For example, an instance in the public subnet can communicate with an instance in a private subnet 
(e.g., 10.0.2.5) without needing to go through the internet.

Security and Control:

Even in a public subnet, the instances are not directly exposed to the internet by default. They are still 
protected by security groups and network access control lists (ACLs).
Public access is only allowed through an Internet Gateway (IGW), which is attached to the public subnet.

Public Internet Access:

>What makes it a public subnet is that instances within it can access the internet directly via the Internet Gateway (IGW).
>If an instance in the public subnet needs to be accessible from the internet (e.g., a web server), 
it can be assigned an Elastic IP (EIP) or a Public IP address.
>This public IP will map to the instance's private IP for external traffic. For example, an Elastic IP 
of 54.239.28.85 might be assigned to the instance with private IP 10.0.1.5. Traffic from the internet can now reach the
instance via the public IP, but the instance will still use its private IP for internal VPC communication.

Why Use Public Subnets in a Network?
Public subnets are used when you have resources that need to communicate with the internet. 
For example:
Web Servers: If you host a website, the web server must be in a public subnet so that it can be accessed by users on the internet.
NAT Gateways: In a private subnet setup, you need a NAT Gateway in a public subnet so that instances in private subnets can access the internet.


Summary of Key Concepts:

Public Subnet: A subnet that has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW), allowing instances within it to communicate with the internet.
Instances in a public subnet are still assigned private IP addresses for internal VPC communication.

Private Subnet: A subnet that does not have direct access to the internet. Instances in this subnet are isolated from the
internet unless they use a NAT Gateway for outbound traffic.

Elastic IP or Public IP: If an instance in a public subnet needs to be accessible from the internet (e.g., web server),
it is assigned a public IP (like an Elastic IP) which maps to its private IP.


MORE DOUBTS CLEARED

When you host a website, you need your web server to be reachable by users over the internet. A public subnet 
enables this by allowing the web server to have direct internet access. 
Let’s break down how this works:

What Does It Mean?

A web server is the machine (physical or virtual, like an AWS EC2 instance) that hosts your website, serving 
content like HTML, images, CSS, etc.

The web server must be in a public subnet so that users from anywhere on the internet can send requests 
(e.g., visiting your website) and get responses (like viewing your homepage).

How Does It Work?

Web Server in a Public Subnet:

Your web server (EC2 instance) is deployed in a public subnet within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
A public subnet is defined as a subnet that is connected to the internet through an Internet Gateway (IGW).
The EC2 instance in this subnet gets a private IP address (e.g., 10.0.1.5) to communicate internally within the VPC.


Assign a Public IP Address:

To make your web server accessible over the internet, it is assigned a public IP address 
or an Elastic IP (e.g., 52.10.45.123).
This public IP is mapped to the instance’s private IP via a network address translation (NAT) mechanism.

Route Through the Internet Gateway:

The public subnet is associated with a route table that has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW), which
allows traffic to flow between the internet and the public subnet.
When users access your website by entering your domain name or the public IP (52.10.45.123), their 
requests are routed through the internet to the Internet Gateway, which then forwards them to
the web server's private IP (10.0.1.5).


Security Configuration:
Security groups and Network Access Control Lists (ACLs) are used to secure the traffic.
For a web server, the security group typically allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) or
port 443 (HTTPS) so that users can access the website.
For example, you may configure your security group to allow incoming traffic from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) on port 80 for HTTP requests.


Traffic Flow Example:
User Request:
A user opens their browser and types in www.example.com (which is mapped to your web server’s public IP: 52.10.45.123).

Routing:
The request travels over the internet and reaches your VPC’s Internet Gateway.
The Internet Gateway routes the traffic to the public subnet where your web server is hosted.
The request is then forwarded to your web server’s private IP (e.g., 10.0.1.5).

Response:
Your web server processes the request and sends back the appropriate content (like the homepage of the website) to the user.
The response is routed back through the Internet Gateway to the user’s browser.


Why Use a Public Subnet for Web Servers?

Direct Internet Access: A public subnet allows your web server to receive traffic directly from the internet. 
This is essential for any website or service that needs to be publicly accessible.

Static Public IP: You can assign a static Elastic IP to your web server, so it has a fixed address that users can always reach.

Security: Although the server is publicly accessible, you can still control who can access it
by configuring the security group rules to allow traffic only on necessary ports (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) and block other ports.

Summary:
Hosting a web server in a public subnet allows users from the internet to access it.
The web server is assigned a private IP for internal communication but is reachable via its public IP through an Internet Gateway.
Security configurations (like security groups) ensure that only the required traffic (e.g., web traffic) is allowed to reach the server
