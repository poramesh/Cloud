AWS Control Tower 

1. Overview of AWS Control Tower
AWS Control Tower builds on AWS Organizations to provide automated governance and management of multiple AWS accounts.
It creates a Landing Zone, which is a well-architected, multi-account baseline with security and compliance best practices.
Organizations can create a similar setup manually, but Control Tower automates the process.


2. AWS Control Tower Features
>Automated multi-account setup with predefined security and compliance.
>Pre-configured organizational structure:
Management Account (Root)
Security OU
Sandbox OU
Production OU
Shared Accounts (Audit & Log Archive)
>Guardrails for governance and security:
Preventive Guardrails → Restrict actions before they happen.
Detective Guardrails → Monitor violations after they happen.
>Integration with AWS IAM Identity Center (for SSO and user management).


3. Landing Zone Components
A Landing Zone is a predefined AWS environment set up by Control Tower.

It includes:
Management Account (Root of Organization)
Shared Security Accounts:
Log Archive Account → Stores AWS CloudTrail logs and AWS Config logs centrally.
Audit Account → Aggregates security logs and enforces compliance.


4. Guardrails in AWS Control Tower
Preventive Guardrails (Proactive Restrictions)
Implemented using Service Control Policies (SCPs).
Restrict API actions across AWS accounts.
Examples:
Prevent deletion of AWS CloudTrail logs.
Disallow public read access to S3 buckets.
Require encryption on EBS volumes.
Block SSH/RDP access from "0.0.0.0/0" (open internet).

Detective Guardrails (Monitoring & Compliance)
Implemented using AWS Config rules.
Detects non-compliance and can trigger remediation actions.
Examples:
Detect publicly accessible S3 buckets.
Check if S3 versioning is enabled.
Ensure RDS instances are encrypted.
Monitor IAM policies for excessive permissions.
