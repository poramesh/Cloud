AWS Organizations

A management service to collect, organize, and manage multiple AWS accounts.
Allows centralized billing and governance policies across accounts.
Enables automated AWS account creation and management.

All usage is aggregated, but each account remains independent.
Benefits:

Volume pricing discounts across accounts.
b) All Features
Includes Service Control Policies (SCPs) and Tag Policies.
Enables advanced governance and security.


AWS Organizations Hierarchy

Management Account (Root Account)
The top-level account that creates and manages the Organization.
Previously called the master account.
Handles billing but cannot access resources of other accounts.

Member (Linked) Accounts
Independent AWS accounts that are centrally managed.
Can have different roles, users, and groups.

Organizational Units (OUs)
Group accounts together for easier management.
Policies like SCPs can be applied at the OU level.


Key Features in AWS Organizations
a) Service Control Policies (SCPs)
Security control mechanism that limits permissions in member accounts.
SCPs define the maximum permissions available to accounts.
Applied at the root, OU, or account level.
b) Tag Policies
Enforce consistent tagging across AWS resources.
c) AWS Single Sign-On (SSO)
Centralized authentication across AWS accounts.
Supports Active Directory integration.
d) AWS CloudTrail Integration
Enables centralized logging of AWS API activity for compliance.
Can be applied across all accounts from the management account.
e) Programmatic Account Creation
AWS Organizations API allows for automated account creation.
New accounts can be automatically assigned to OUs.
