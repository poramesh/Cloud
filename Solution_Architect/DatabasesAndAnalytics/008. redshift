Amazon Redshift:

Amazon Redshift is a fast, fully managed data warehouse.
It is designed for analytics and can be used with business intelligence tools.
SQL-based data warehouse, optimized for Online Analytical Processing (OLAP), used for complex querying and reporting.
Redshift uses Amazon EC2 instances, and you pay based on the type and family of instance used.
Redshift maintains three copies of your data and provides continuous and incremental backups.


OLTP vs OLAP:
OLTP (Online Transaction Processing):
Used for transactional databases (e.g., Amazon RDS, DynamoDB).
For example, customer orders in an online store.

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing):
Focuses on running complex queries and long transactions on data pulled from OLTP systems.
Redshift is an example of a data warehouse used for OLAP.
Uses data from multiple sources (e.g., RDS, DynamoDB) to run analytics across a wide dataset.


Reporting and Analytics Use Cases:
Simple Reporting:
Use a read replica of an RDS database to run reports without impacting performance on the transactional database.
The read replica holds synchronized, live data from the original database.

Aggregating Data from Multiple RDS Databases:
When running queries on multiple RDS databases (e.g., across different regions), itâ€™s better to load the data into Redshift for analytics.
Redshift enables querying across these collections of data without performance hits on production databases.


Data Sources for Redshift:
Redshift can pull data from various sources including:
RDS
DynamoDB
Amazon EMR
Amazon S3
AWS Data Pipeline
AWS Glue
Amazon EC2
On-premises servers
Redshift Spectrum allows you to run SQL queries directly on data stored in Amazon S3.


Use Cases for Redshift:
Complex Queries: Ideal for running complex queries on large datasets.
Structured & Semi-structured Data: Works well with both types of data.
Fast Performance: Redshift is designed for fast query performance on large datasets.
Frequent Access: Good for frequently accessed data that requires consistent and structured formats.
Managed Data Warehouse: Redshift offers a managed solution with automated provisioning, configuration, patching, and continuous backups to S3.
Exabyte-scale Query Capability: Redshift scales efficiently to handle large amounts of data.

Key Features:
Automated provisioning, configuration, patching.
Data Durability with continuous backups to S3.
Scalability with simple API calls.
Redshift Spectrum allows SQL queries on S3 data.
