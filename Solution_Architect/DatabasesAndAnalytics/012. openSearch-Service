Amazon OpenSearch Service (formerly Amazon Elasticsearch Service)

************
OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics engine, originally derived from Elasticsearch after version 7.10.
It was developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide a community-driven alternative to Elasticsearch and Kibana, which transitioned to a more restrictive license.

Key Features:
Full-Text Search: Supports powerful text search capabilities, including relevance ranking.
Distributed Architecture: Designed for scalability and high availability.
Analytics and Visualization: Includes OpenSearch Dashboards (similar to Kibana).
Security Features: Offers encryption, role-based access control (RBAC), and authentication options.
Compatibility: Works with Elasticsearch 7.10 APIs, making migration easier.

Common Use Cases:
Log and Event Analytics: Used for analyzing application logs and monitoring system performance.
Search Applications: Powering search functionalities in applications and websites.
Observability: Helps in monitoring infrastructure, security logs, and metrics.
************

Fully managed service for searching, visualizing, and analyzing text and unstructured data.
Petabyte scale, secure, highly available, and scalable.
Deploys nodes and replicas across Availability Zones (AZs).
Based on open-source Elasticsearch and supports SQL queries.
Scales by adding/removing EC2 instances (not serverless).
Supports backup via snapshots.
Encryption: at rest & in transit.

Deployment
Cluster = OpenSearch Service Domain
Deployed via Management Console, API, or CLI.
Configure instance types, number of instances, and storage (UltraWarm, Cold Storage).

Data Ingestion
Sources:
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
Logstash
Elasticsearch/OpenSearch APIs

Visualization & Analysis
Use Kibana (now called OpenSearch Dashboards) for:
Searching, visualizing, and analyzing data.
Pointing dashboards to OpenSearch clusters.

VPC vs. Public Deployment
VPC Deployment:
Secure intra-VPC communication.
Requires VPN or proxy for external access.
Limitations:
No IP-based access policies.
Cannot switch to a public endpoint.
Cannot move between VPCs (but can modify subnets/security groups).
Public Domain:
Direct access from the internet.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Logstash → Ingests data into OpenSearch.
OpenSearch → Stores and indexes data.
Kibana (OpenSearch Dashboards) → Visualizes and analyzes data.
Use cases:
Application & infrastructure monitoring.
Log aggregation & analysis.
Security analytics & troubleshooting.

Access Control
Resource-based policies (Domain Access Policies).
Identity-based policies (IAM Users/Roles).
IP-based policies (not available for VPC deployments).
Fine-Grained Access Control (RBAC, Index/Field-level security, Multi-tenancy).

Authentication Options
SAML Federation (for on-premises directories like Active Directory).
Amazon Cognito (for social identity providers).


Best Practices
Deploy across 3 AZs for best availability.
Use multiples of 3 instances for equal AZ distribution.
If 3 AZs are unavailable, use 2 AZs with equal instances.
Use 3 dedicated master nodes.
Configure at least one replica per index.
Apply restrictive resource-based access policies.
Deploy in Amazon VPC for security.
Enable Node-to-Node Encryption & Encryption at Rest for sensitive data.

Exam Tips
Amazon OpenSearch Service = Elasticsearch (same concepts apply).
Hands-on knowledge is not required—just focus on concepts.
Expect exam questions on deployment, access control, and best practices.
