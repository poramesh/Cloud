Amazon OpenSearch Service (formerly Amazon Elasticsearch Service)

Fully managed service for searching, visualizing, and analyzing text and unstructured data.
Petabyte scale, secure, highly available, and scalable.
Deploys nodes and replicas across Availability Zones (AZs).
Based on open-source Elasticsearch and supports SQL queries.
Scales by adding/removing EC2 instances (not serverless).
Supports backup via snapshots.
Encryption: at rest & in transit.

Deployment
Cluster = OpenSearch Service Domain
Deployed via Management Console, API, or CLI.
Configure instance types, number of instances, and storage (UltraWarm, Cold Storage).

Data Ingestion
Sources:
Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
Logstash
Elasticsearch/OpenSearch APIs

Visualization & Analysis
Use Kibana (now called OpenSearch Dashboards) for:
Searching, visualizing, and analyzing data.
Pointing dashboards to OpenSearch clusters.

VPC vs. Public Deployment
VPC Deployment:
Secure intra-VPC communication.
Requires VPN or proxy for external access.
Limitations:
No IP-based access policies.
Cannot switch to a public endpoint.
Cannot move between VPCs (but can modify subnets/security groups).
Public Domain:
Direct access from the internet.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Logstash → Ingests data into OpenSearch.
OpenSearch → Stores and indexes data.
Kibana (OpenSearch Dashboards) → Visualizes and analyzes data.
Use cases:
Application & infrastructure monitoring.
Log aggregation & analysis.
Security analytics & troubleshooting.

Access Control
Resource-based policies (Domain Access Policies).
Identity-based policies (IAM Users/Roles).
IP-based policies (not available for VPC deployments).
Fine-Grained Access Control (RBAC, Index/Field-level security, Multi-tenancy).

Authentication Options
SAML Federation (for on-premises directories like Active Directory).
Amazon Cognito (for social identity providers).


Best Practices
Deploy across 3 AZs for best availability.
Use multiples of 3 instances for equal AZ distribution.
If 3 AZs are unavailable, use 2 AZs with equal instances.
Use 3 dedicated master nodes.
Configure at least one replica per index.
Apply restrictive resource-based access policies.
Deploy in Amazon VPC for security.
Enable Node-to-Node Encryption & Encryption at Rest for sensitive data.

Exam Tips
Amazon OpenSearch Service = Elasticsearch (same concepts apply).
Hands-on knowledge is not required—just focus on concepts.
Expect exam questions on deployment, access control, and best practices.
