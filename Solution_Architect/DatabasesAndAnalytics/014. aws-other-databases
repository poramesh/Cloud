Database Services

1. Amazon DocumentDB
MongoDB-compatible managed database service.
Purpose-built for JSON data management at scale.
Scalability: Storage automatically scales up to 64 TB without affecting applications.
Performance: Handles millions of requests per second with up to 15 low-latency read replicas.
Availability: 99.99% (four nines) uptime, replicating six copies of data across three Availability Zones.
Migration: Can migrate from MongoDB using AWS Database Migration Service (DMS).
Use Case: Ideal for applications needing MongoDB-style document storage with managed scalability.

2. Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra)
Managed Apache Cassandra-compatible database service.
Serverless and highly scalable, automatically adjusts to workload traffic.
Performance: Supports thousands of requests per second with low-latency responses.
Availability: 99.99% SLA within a region.
Use Case: Best for applications requiring Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and need high availability, scalability, and automatic management.

3. Amazon Neptune
Fully managed graph database service.
Designed for tracking relationships between entities.
Supports open-source graph query languages:
Gremlin, openCypher, SPARQL.
Performance:
99.99% availability.
Fault-tolerant and self-healing storage.
Storage grows in increments of 10 GB, up to 64 TB.
Up to 15 read replicas for scalability.
Use Case: Best for applications like identity management, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, and recommendation engines.

4. Amazon QLDB (Quantum Ledger Database)
Fully managed ledger database.
Immutable and cryptographically verifiable transaction log.
Append-only journal:
Data cannot be changed or deleted once written.
Ensures auditability and data integrity.
Uses cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) to secure change history.
Serverless and automatically scalable.
Use Case: Best for applications needing immutable, tamper-proof transaction records, such as financial transactions, supply chain tracking, and compliance logs.

Exam Tips
If you see MongoDB in a question → Think of DocumentDB.
If you see Apache Cassandra → Think of Keyspaces.
If a question mentions relationships and graph queries → Think of Neptune.
If the focus is on immutability, transaction logs, or audit trails → Think of QLDB.
