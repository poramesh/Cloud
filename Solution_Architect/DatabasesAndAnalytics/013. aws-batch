AWS Batch
AWS Batch is a managed service that allows running batch workloads on AWS.
It is used for executing large-scale computing jobs that require significant resources.

Key Concepts:

Batch Job:
A unit of work (e.g., shell scripts, executables, or Docker container images).
Represents the computing task that needs to be performed.

Job Definition:
Defines the requirements of the batch job, such as the compute resources needed.

Job Queue:
Jobs are submitted to a queue before being processed.

Compute Environment:
AWS Batch provisions and manages the required computing resources.
It uses EC2 instances and ECS (Elastic Container Service) for execution.
Managed vs. Unmanaged Options:
Managed Mode: AWS handles resource provisioning and scaling automatically.
Unmanaged Mode: You take full control over the resources and configurations.

Key Benefits:
Automated provisioning: AWS launches and terminates instances as needed.
Efficient resource usage: Only the required compute capacity is allocated.
Integration with EC2 and ECS: Supports both virtual machines and containers.

Exam Relevance:
AWS Batch is not a major exam topic but might appear in some questions.
Just understanding the high-level concept is sufficient.
