*********
these two are analytics services.
One is Amazon Athena, and the other is AWS Glue.
So Amazon Athena is a serverless service
that we can use to run SQL queries against data.
Now principally that data is on Amazon S3.
So you point Athena at your data source in S3
and then run SQL queries against it.
Now the Athena can actually query data
in a few different formats.
You've got CSV, TSV, JSON and Apache Parquet
and ORC formats.
******

Amazon Athena:

Purpose: A serverless service to run SQL queries against data, primarily in Amazon S3.
Supported Data Formats:
CSV, TSV, JSON, Apache Parquet, and ORC formats.
Data Catalog:
AWS Glue can be used as a managed data catalog to store metadata, helping build tables in Athena.
Data Sources:
Primarily queries data in Amazon S3.
Can query other data sources (e.g., CloudWatch logs) via AWS Lambda (connects Athena to other data sources).

Key Features of Athena:
Serverless: No need to manage infrastructure.
SQL Queries: Run SQL queries directly on S3 data and other sources through Lambda.

Performance Optimization Tips:
Partition data: Break data into partitions for faster queries.
Bucket data within a partition: Further optimize partitioned data.
Compression: Use formats like Apache Parquet or ORC.
Optimize file sizes: Ensure files are appropriately sized for efficient querying.
Columnar data format: Use for better performance (e.g., Parquet, ORC).
Use only needed columns: Reduces unnecessary data scanning.
Use approximate functions: For faster, less precise results in some cases.
Optimize SQL operations: Use optimized ORDER BY, GROUP BY, etc.


AWS Glue:
Purpose: A fully managed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) service.
Primary Use: Prepares data for analytics in data lakes, warehouses, and data stores.
Runs on Apache Spark: ETL jobs are run on a fully managed, scalable Apache Spark environment.

Key Features of AWS Glue:
Data Discovery & Metadata:
AWS Glue discovers data and stores metadata in the Glue Data Catalog.
Can work with data on S3, Redshift, RDS, and EC2.
Crawler:
A Crawler can scan data stores and automatically populate the Glue Data Catalog with tables.
Crawler can scan multiple data stores in a single run and create or update tables.
ETL Jobs:
Create ETL jobs using the Glue Data Catalog tables as sources and targets.
Integration between Athena and Glue:
Glue Data Catalog is used to store the schema and metadata for Athena queries.
