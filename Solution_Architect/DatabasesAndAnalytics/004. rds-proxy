 Amazon RDS Proxy:

Fully Managed Service: RDS Proxy is a fully managed database proxy for Amazon RDS and Aurora.
High Availability: It’s designed to be highly available across multiple availability zones.
Purpose: Its primary functions are to increase scalability, fault tolerance, and security for connections to RDS databases.

Core Use Case: Serverless Applications

Serverless Integration: RDS Proxy is particularly useful when you have serverless applications (e.g., using AWS Lambda) that 
scale quickly and unpredictably.
Example: In the example, an Amazon Aurora database is used with a serverless Lambda application. The Lambda functions can scale independently, 
but that can overload the relational database.

How RDS Proxy Works:

Connection Pooling: RDS Proxy sits between the serverless application (like Lambda) and the database (like Aurora).
Serverless functions connect to the connection pool managed by the proxy, which contains pre-established database connections.

Benefits of Connection Pooling:
Reduces Database Load: By reusing database connections, it helps to reduce stress on the CPU and memory of the database.
Improves Efficiency: Shared, infrequently used connections are managed more efficiently.
High Availability: RDS Proxy provides failover support for high availability.
Control Authentication: It also helps manage and control authentication methods used by the database.

Summary:
RDS Proxy sits in front of your relational database (RDS or Aurora) and manages a pool of connections.

Serverless functions (like Lambda) can scale independently, and instead of creating new connections to the database each time, they connect to the proxy’s 
connection pool for improved scalability, performance, and efficiency.






What is a Proxy in General?

A proxy is essentially an intermediary between two entities, typically a client and a server. It acts as a middleman that facilitates communication, 
often providing added functionality like caching, load balancing, security, or access control.

In the case of a database proxy, the proxy sits between the client (like your application) and the database (like Amazon RDS or Aurora),
helping to manage and optimize the connections between them.



What is a Connection Pool?

A connection pool is a cache of database connections that are maintained and reused rather than opening and closing new connections each time 
an application needs to communicate with the database. Instead of creating a new connection every time a request is made (which can be
slow and resource-intensive), a connection pool allows applications to borrow an already established connection from the pool.
