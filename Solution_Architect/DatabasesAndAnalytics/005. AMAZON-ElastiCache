Amazon ElastiCache

What is ElastiCache?
A fully managed in-memory caching service supporting Redis and Memcached.

Use Cases:
Caching: Reduce latency by caching frequent queries (e.g., user session data).
Real-Time Analytics: Analyze high-velocity data in-memory for speed.

Example:
An e-commerce site caching product pages to reduce database load during flash sales.

Scaling ElastiCache

Horizontal Scaling:
Add or remove nodes in a cluster.
Suitable for Redis and Memcached.

Vertical Scaling:
Change the instance size of a node.

Replication:
Use replicas to improve read scalability.
Example:
A social media app scaling to handle spikes in user activity.


Create ElastiCache Cluster

Steps:
Go to the AWS Management Console.
Choose ElastiCache, then create a new Redis or Memcached cluster.
Configure node type, number of nodes, and replication.
Example:
Create a Redis cluster with 2 replicas for high availability to store user session data.
