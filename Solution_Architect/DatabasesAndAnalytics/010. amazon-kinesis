Amazon Kinesis Lesson Notes:

Overview:
Amazon Kinesis is a service for handling streaming data.
Data sources could include IoT sensors, factory devices, cars, or other sources generating continuous streams of data.
Kinesis is used for ingesting, processing, and storing this data in real-time.

Key Services in the Kinesis Family:
Kinesis Data Streams: Ingests continuous data for processing.
Kinesis Data Analytics: Processes real-time data streams using SQL and Apache Flink.
Kinesis Data Firehose: Loads data to other services like S3, Redshift, and more.
Kinesis Video Streams: A service for video data streaming (not covered in the exam).

How It Works:
Producers send data to Kinesis Data Streams.
The data is stored in shards for 24 hours by default, up to 365 days.
Consumers process the data and can store it in services like S3, DynamoDB, or Redshift.
The streaming process involves real-time latency of around 200 milliseconds.

Kinesis Data Streams:
Data is captured and stored in shards, which are units of storage and processing.
Producers send data into Kinesis, where it's stored in the shards.
Consumers use Kinesis Client Library (KCL) to process data from shards.
A partition key can be specified for grouping data by shard.
Order is maintained within a shard but not across shards.
KCL workers process data from shards, with one worker per shard.

***Suppose you have a stream of data from different sensors, each identified by a sensor ID. If you use the sensor ID as the partition key, 
all data coming from the same sensor will be placed into the same shard. This is important because you might need 
to process all the data from a particular sensor in sequence.
***
Kinesis Data Firehose:
Unlike data streams, Firehose does not use shards and is fully automated for scalability.
It captures, transforms, and loads data directly into destinations like S3, Redshift, or OpenSearch.
Data is processed and transformed with AWS Lambda.
Firehose has near-real-time delivery, with around 60 seconds of latency.
Supported destinations include S3, Redshift, Splunk, Datadog, and more.

Kinesis Data Analytics:
Provides real-time SQL processing for streaming data.
Can process data from Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, and AWS Lambda.
Kinesis Data Analytics helps run SQL queries on streaming data.
Output can be loaded into Kinesis Data Firehose for storage in various destinations.

Summary of Key Features:
Real-time Streaming: Amazon Kinesis enables real-time processing of data with minimal latency.
Elastic Scalability: Data Firehose scales automatically, while Data Streams require manual scaling of shards.
Data Destinations: Processed data can be forwarded to services like S3, DynamoDB, Redshift, and others for storage or further analysis.
Kinesis Client Library (KCL): Helps consumers process data from streams.
