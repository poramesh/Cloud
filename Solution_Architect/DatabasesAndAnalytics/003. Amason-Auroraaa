Amazon Aurora Overview

1. Introduction to Amazon Aurora
Amazon Aurora is a database service in the Amazon RDS family, developed by AWS.
Known for high durability and scalability.
Aurora is AWSâ€™s fastest-growing product, offering significant performance improvements over traditional databases.

2. Key Features of Aurora
Relational Database Engines: Supports MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Performance:
5x faster than MySQL.
3x faster than PostgreSQL.
Storage:
Distributed, fault-tolerant, and self-healing storage layer.
Can scale up to 128 TB per database instance.

3. Aurora Architecture
Region & Availability Zones:
Multiple availability zones within a region.
A primary database and one or more replicas within the region.
Replicas can be spread across different availability zones but always remain within the same region (Aurora replicas).
Storage Layer:
Data is replicated six times across multiple storage volumes.
Primary database handles writes; both the primary and replicas handle reads.
Fault Tolerance:
Aurora provides fault tolerance across three availability zones using a single logical volume.

4. Replicas & Scalability
Aurora Replicas:
Scale out read requests.
Can promote replicas to be the new primary database.
Up to 15 Aurora replicas.
Auto-scaling for read traffic.
Replication Type: Asynchronous with low latency (milliseconds for Aurora).
Failover:
Aurora replicas are automatic failover targets, minimizing downtime.
MySQL replicas do not automatically failover.

5. Cross-Region Replication & Other Features
MySQL Read Replicas:
Cross-region read scaling.
Up to 5 MySQL read replicas, each supporting 15 Aurora replicas.
Potential minutes of data loss in case of failover.

Global Database:
Cross-region clusters with read scaling.
Failover can occur across regions.
Only one region has the writable copy at a time.

Multi-Master:
Allows scaling of writes within a region (each Aurora instance can write).
Not yet common on the AWS exam.

Aurora Serverless:
Auto-scaling on demand.
Not always running; instantiated when traffic appears.
Does not support read replicas or public IPs.
Accessible only via VPC or Direct Connect, not VPN.

6. Comparison: Aurora Replicas vs MySQL Replicas
Feature              Aurora Replica	            MySQL Replica
Max Replicas	       15	                        5
Replication Type	   Asynchronous (low latency)	Asynchronous (higher latency)
Performance Impact	 Low	                      Higher (due to replication)
Replication Scope	   In-region	                Cross-region
Failover	           Automatic	                Manual
Data Loss in Failover	None	                    Up to minutes
Failover Target	      Yes	                      Yes

7. Other Aurora Features
Point-in-Time Recovery: Supports continuous backup to Amazon S3.
Database Compatibility: Works with both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
Automatic Failover: Aurora replicas support automatic failover, ensuring minimal downtime.
High Availability: Scale read traffic and ensure availability by using Aurora replicas.


Key Takeaways:
Amazon Aurora provides excellent scalability, fault tolerance, and performance, especially for workloads that require high availability and durability.
Aurora replicas are designed for in-region scaling, automatic failover, and low-latency replication.
Aurora Serverless offers an auto-scaling solution with on-demand instantiation
