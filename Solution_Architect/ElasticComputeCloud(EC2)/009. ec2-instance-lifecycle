EC2 Instance Life Cycle: Detailed Notes

The EC2 instance life cycle refers to the stages an EC2 instance goes through from launch to termination. Understanding these stages and how
to manage your instances is essential for effective EC2 usage. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of the different states in the life cycle of an EC2 instance:


1. Launch (Pending State):
Launching an EC2 instance begins with selecting an Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
The instance is in the Pending state when it is starting up. It means the instance is being provisioned(When resources are "provisioned," it means that they
have been prepared, configured, and made available for use.) but has not yet fully initialized.


2. Running (Running State):
Once the instance is fully initialized and operational, it enters the Running state.
In the Running state, the instance is up and functioning. You can interact with it (e.g., SSH into a Linux instance or RDP into a Windows instance).
Rebooting the instance from the running state will cause it to go into the Booting state, after which it will return to Running.


3. Rebooting:
Rebooting the instance is similar to restarting an operating system.
It can be done via the AWS EC2 console or by using the operating system's reboot commands (though AWS recommends doing it via EC2 for consistency).
What stays unchanged after reboot:
The instance DNS name and IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) are retained.
No charges for rebooting as it doesn't result in any stop or termination of the instance.
Billing remains unaffected by a reboot.


4. Stop / Hibernate (Stopping State):
Stopping an instance is applicable only to EBS-backed instances. If the root volume is instance-store-backed, you cannot stop the instance.
********
Stopping is available only for EBS-backed instances.
For instance-store-backed instances((temporary storage tied directly to the physical host that the instance is running on), you cannot stop them. Instead,
when the instance is stopped, the data is wiped, and the instance cannot be
resumed from its previous state. If you want to retain data on these instances, you'd need to store it on an EBS volume instead.
*******
Stop Process:
The instance transitions into the Stopping state, then to the Stopped state.
The instance is shut down, but the data on the attached EBS volumes remains intact. The instance is charged for the storage of EBS volumes,
but there are no charges for compute.
When restarted, it will boot again and regain its previous state, but the underlying hardware may be different as the instance could be migrated 
to a new host (AWS will automatically manage this).
stopping an instance will lose the data in RAM because RAM is a volatile memory, meaning it only holds data while the instance (or computer) is powered on.

When to Stop an Instance:
Stopping is useful when you no longer need to use the instance for a period of time but want to retain the instance and data on EBS volumes for future use.
AWS uses the stop/start functionality to migrate instances to a different host if there’s scheduled maintenance or issues with the current host.
Public IPv4 addresses are released when the instance is stopped (unless the instance uses Elastic IP addresses).
Elastic IP addresses are retained even if the instance is stopped.

Hibernate:

Available on supported AMIs and requires enabling hibernation at the time of instance launch.
When the instance is hibernated, the contents of RAM are saved to the EBS volume.
Upon starting the instance again, the root volume is restored to its previous state, and the RAM contents are reloaded back into memory, resuming processes.
Attached data volumes are also re-attached, and the instance retains its Instance ID.


********
How RAM is Storage

Temporary/Volatile Storage:
RAM stores data temporarily while a computer is running. It holds data that the CPU needs to access quickly for processing.
Once the computer is turned off, all data stored in RAM is lost because it is volatile memory.

High-Speed Storage:
RAM is designed for speed rather than capacity. It can read and write data much faster than HDDs or SSDs.
This speed makes RAM ideal for storing the operating system’s active processes, applications, and any data actively being used or processed.

Examples:
When you open an application:
The operating system loads the program from the SSD/HDD into RAM so the CPU can access it quickly.
Any changes made (e.g., editing a document) are stored in RAM temporarily until saved.

When you save a file:
The data is written from RAM to the HDD/SSD for long-term storage

**********

5. Terminating (Terminated State):
Termination of an instance means permanent deletion. Once terminated:
The instance cannot be recovered.
The root EBS volume is deleted by default, meaning all data on the root volume is lost forever.
The instance's associated public IPv4 (if applicable) is released.
If the instance was using Elastic IP, the IP will be freed, but can be reassigned elsewhere.

Terminate Process:
The instance enters the Shutting down state and then moves to the Terminated state.
Instances are typically terminated when no longer needed to avoid ongoing charges.
Key Point: Terminated instances are gone forever, and you cannot recover them after termination. Snapshots and AMIs 
can be used to back up and restore instances.

6. Retiring Instances:
AWS may retire instances if it detects an irreparable failure in the underlying hardware hosting the instance.
When an instance is marked for retirement, AWS will schedule it to be stopped or terminated. This process is managed automatically by AWS.
This is a precautionary measure for hardware failure, and AWS ensures minimal impact on your EC2 instances.


7. CloudWatch Recovery:
CloudWatch can monitor system status and notify you of potential issues (e.g., system status checks failures).
If an instance becomes impaired due to underlying platform issues, CloudWatch allows you to recover the instance to restore its functionality.
The recovered instance is identical to the original one, retaining the same configuration and data (if it was backed by EBS).


Key Points Summary:
Stopping and Hibernating are only for EBS-backed instances.
Public IPv4 addresses are released when an instance is stopped or terminated, except for Elastic IPs.
Rebooting does not affect the instance’s data or IP addresses.
Terminating an instance results in permanent deletion of the instance and, by default, the root EBS volume.
Elastic IP addresses are retained across stops, hibernations, and terminations (unless the Elastic IP is disassociated).
Hibernation saves the contents of RAM to EBS and allows the instance to resume its previous state when started again.
