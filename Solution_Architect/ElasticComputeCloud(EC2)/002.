Instance Metadata

Instance Metadata is data about your EC2 instance.
It provides runtime information about the instance, such as:
AMI ID
Public/Private IPv4 addresses
Instance ID
Region and Availability Zone
Many more details specific to the instance.


How to Access Instance Metadata?

Metadata Path: http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

This is a special HTTP endpoint available from within the instance.

Retrieve Metadata Using curl:
Example to retrieve the general metadata tree:

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

The output will list metadata categories such as ami-id, hostname, local-ipv4, etc.


Retrieve Specific Metadata:

Example to retrieve the local IPv4 address:

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4
169.254.169.254
This will return the local (private) IPv4 address of the instance.

Example to retrieve the public IPv4 address:

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
3.26.54.18
This will return the public IP of the instance.


Instance Metadata Service Versions (IMDS)

Version 1 (IMDSv1):
Older and less secure.
Metadata can be accessed directly without authentication.
Examples above (curl commands) are based on IMDSv1.

Version 2 (IMDSv2):
More secure, requiring a session token for authentication.
Default for the latest AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).
Protects against attacks like server-side request forgery (SSRF).

How to Use IMDSv2:
Obtain a session token:
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

Use the token to retrieve metadata:
curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

Configuring Metadata Service During Instance Launch:
When launching an instance, you can configure:
Metadata accessibility: Enable or disable metadata service access.
Metadata version: IMDSv1 or IMDSv2 (default is IMDSv2).
These settings are available in the Advanced Settings during instance creation.


User Data
What is User Data?
User Data allows you to run custom scripts or commands when an instance starts for the first time.
It's typically used to:
Install software.
Configure applications.
Automate instance setup.
User Data Script Examples
Using the AWS Management Console:
During instance launch, under Advanced Settings, add the script to the User Data field.

Example (Linux):
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
This script updates the instance, installs Apache (httpd), and starts the web server.
After launch, the instance will run this script once.

Using the AWS CLI:
Use the --user-data option with a file containing your script.
Example:
bash
Copy code
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id ami-0123456789abcdef0 \
    --count 1 \
    --instance-type t2.micro \
    --key-name MyKeyPair \
    --security-group-ids sg-0123456789abcdef0 \
    --subnet-id subnet-0123456789abcdef0 \
    --user-data file://my-user-data-script.sh
Key Points About User Data:
Encoding: User Data must be Base64 encoded.

The console and CLI handle encoding automatically.
Execution Limits:

Limited to 16 KB in raw form (before Base64 encoding).
Runs only once, at the first boot of the instance.
Stopping and Editing User Data:

You can stop the instance and edit the User Data.
However, the modified User Data will not run unless the instance is relaunched.
Combining Metadata and User Data
You can combine metadata and user data to create dynamic scripts.

Example:

Retrieve the instance's private IP and include it in a configuration file during setup.
Script:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
PRIVATE_IP=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4)
echo "Private IP: $PRIVATE_IP" > /var/www/html/index.html
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
This script sets up a web server and displays the instanceâ€™s private IP on the homepage.
