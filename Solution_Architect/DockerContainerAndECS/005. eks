1. What is EKS?
EKS is a managed service for running Kubernetes applications in AWS or on-premises.
Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications (like those using Docker).

2. When to Use EKS?
Use EKS to standardize container orchestration across multiple environments, such as AWS and on-premises data centers.

3. Key Features of EKS:
Hybrid Deployments: Manage Kubernetes clusters and applications across both AWS and on-premises.
Batch Processing: Run sequential or batch workloads using the Kubernetes Jobs API.
Machine Learning: Use Kubeflow with EKS for machine learning workflows, leveraging EC2 GPU-powered instances.
Web Applications: Build scalable and highly available web applications that auto-scale across multiple availability zones (AZs).

4. EKS Architecture:
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with multiple availability zones and EKS service running on EC2, Fargate, and Outposts.
Control Plane: Managed by AWS.
Worker Nodes: Run your applications.
Pods: Groups of containers in Kubernetes.
Load Balancers: EKS supports ALB (Application Load Balancer), NLB (Network Load Balancer), and CLB (Classic Load Balancer, deprecated).

5. Autoscaling in EKS:
Cluster Autoscaling: Scales the worker nodes.
Vertical Pod Autoscaler: Adjusts CPU and memory for individual pods (vertical scaling).
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler: Scales the number of pods in a deployment (horizontal scaling).
Workload Autoscaling:
Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler: Uses AWS scaling groups.
Karpenter: An open-source autoscaling project that works with EC2 fleets.

6. Load Balancing with EKS:
NLB and ALB are the main load balancers.
AWS Load Balancer Controller manages these load balancers in Kubernetes.
The controller provisions an ALB when creating a Kubernetes ingress and an NLB when creating a Kubernetes service of type LoadBalancer.

7. EKS Distro:
A distribution of Kubernetes that replicates EKS with the same dependencies.
You can run Kubernetes clusters anywhere (on AWS EC2 or on-premises hardware).
It includes open-source Kubernetes binaries, networking, and storage plugins, with regular updates for compatibility.

8. EKS and ECS Anywhere:
Allows running EKS or ECS on customer-managed infrastructure, including bare-metal servers or VMware vSphere.
Can be deployed both on-premises and on AWS Outposts.

9. Conclusion:
EKS is highly versatile, supporting hybrid deployments, scalable workloads, and various environments such as on-premises and cloud-based infrastructure.
It enables efficient Kubernetes cluster management, autoscaling, and integrated load balancing.
This overview should give you a solid foundation for understanding EKS and its core components.
