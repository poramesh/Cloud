Roles in Amazon ECS
ECS relies on several AWS IAM roles to provide permissions for different components to interact with AWS services. These roles
ensure secure access to APIs and resources.

1. Amazon ECS Container Instance IAM Role
Purpose: Provides permissions to EC2 instances running the ECS container agent (relevant for the EC2 launch type).
Functionality:
Allows the container agent on EC2 instances to call AWS APIs on behalf of the instance.
Enables communication between container instances and the ECS service.
Grants permissions for tasks like:
Registering the instance with ECS.
Pulling images from Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).
Sending logs to Amazon CloudWatch.
Policy Example: AWS provides a managed policy (AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role) that includes permissions for ECS, EC2, ECR, and CloudWatch Logs.



2. Task IAM Role
Purpose: Provides permissions to containers (tasks) to access other AWS services.
Functionality:
Enables containers to assume the role defined in the task definition.
Ensures tasks can securely access resources like S3, DynamoDB, or any AWS API needed by the application running in the container.
Best Practice: Tasks can only retrieve credentials for the specific IAM role defined in their task definition.
Security Note: Containers within one task cannot access credentials for roles defined in another task.

3. ECS Task Execution Role
Purpose: Grants permissions required to execute tasks, especially for the Fargate launch type.
Functionality:
Enables ECS agents (Fargate or EC2) to:
Pull container images from registries like ECR or Docker Hub.
Write logs to CloudWatch.
Perform any necessary task setup.
Example Use Case: When running a Fargate task, this role allows the Fargate agent to pull the container image and write logs.

4. ECS Infrastructure IAM Role
Purpose: Used for ECS to manage infrastructure resources such as EBS volumes.
Functionality:
Grants permissions to ECS to provision and manage supporting infrastructure required by tasks.

5. ECS Anywhere IAM Role
Purpose: Provides permissions for on-premises servers or VMs using ECS Anywhere to interact with ECS services.
Functionality:
Allows on-premises resources to communicate with AWS APIs for ECS service integration.

6. ECS CodeDeploy IAM Role
Purpose: Used for blue/green deployments when integrating ECS with CodeDeploy.
Functionality:
Grants permissions to manage task sets and perform deployments.

7. ECS EventBridge IAM Role
Purpose: Enables ECS to integrate with EventBridge for scheduled tasks and event rules.
Functionality:
Provides permissions for EventBridge to trigger ECS tasks or services based on rules.
Applying Permissions in ECS
EC2 Launch Type (ECS EC2 Cluster)
Container Instance (EC2 Instance):
Runs the ECS container agent.
Requires an IAM instance role to:
Communicate with ECS APIs.
Pull container images from ECR.
Send logs to CloudWatch.
Policy Example:
Use the managed policy AmazonEC2ContainerServiceforEC2Role.
Grants permissions for ECS, EC2, ECR, and CloudWatch Logs.
Tasks:
Require a Task IAM Role.
Provides containers with permissions to interact with AWS services (e.g., S3, DynamoDB).
Important Note:
Tasks running on EC2 instances can potentially access the credentials of the IAM instance role. Limit the permissions assigned to the instance role
to avoid exposing unnecessary access to tasks.
Fargate Launch Type
No container instances are managed by the user.
Task IAM Role:
Required to grant permissions to containers for accessing AWS services.
Task Execution Role:
Required to grant permissions for pulling container images and sending logs to CloudWatch.
Key Difference:
Since AWS manages the infrastructure, the Container Instance Role is not relevant in Fargate.
Key Security Considerations
Separation of Roles:
Tasks can only access credentials for their own Task IAM Role.
They cannot access credentials intended for other tasks.
EC2 Instance Role Exposure:
Tasks on EC2 instances may access the credentials of the IAM instance role.
Minimize permissions assigned to the container instance IAM role to limit potential exposure.
Fargate Security:
Fargate tasks are isolated from infrastructure-level credentials since AWS manages the underlying instances.
Summary of Roles by Launch Type
Role	EC2 Launch Type	Fargate Launch Type
Container Instance Role	Required for EC2 instances to interact with ECS and APIs.	Not applicable.
Task IAM Role	Required for containers to access AWS services.	Required for containers to access AWS services.
Task Execution Role	Required for ECS agent tasks (e.g., image pull, logs).	Required for Fargate tasks (e.g., image pull, logs).
Practical Example
EC2 Launch Type:
Container Instance Role: Grants permissions to register with ECS and pull images.
Task IAM Role: Grants S3 read/write access for tasks needing to process data in S3.
Fargate Launch Type:
Task IAM Role: Grants access to a DynamoDB table for tasks.
Task Execution Role: Grants ECS agents permission to pull images and write logs.
These roles enable ECS to manage containers securely and efficiently, adhering to the principle of least privilege.
