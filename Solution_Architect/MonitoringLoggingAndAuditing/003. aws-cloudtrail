AWS CloudTrail 

Purpose:
CloudTrail is a service that logs API activity and captures information about every action (e.g., launching an EC2 instance, modifying a resource, etc.) 
performed in your AWS account.
Principal Use Case: Auditing: CloudTrail helps you understand who did what, when, and on which resources.

API Actions:
Whenever you interact with AWS (via the Management Console, CLI, API, or SDK), an API action is triggered.
CloudTrail logs these API actions for auditing purposes.


Event Logging and Retention

Management Events:
By default, management events (related to resource operations) are logged and retained for 90 days.

CloudTrail Trails:
You can create a CloudTrail trail to log events to Amazon S3, allowing for indefinite retention of logs.

Log File Integrity:
Log File Integrity Validation ensures that the logged events have not been tampered with, which is crucial for auditing and compliance.


Log Destinations

Amazon S3:
Events are typically logged to S3 for long-term storage and retention.

CloudWatch Logs:
You can also forward CloudTrail logs to CloudWatch Logs for processing, creating metric filters, subscription filters, or using CloudWatch Logs Insights.

CloudWatch Events:
CloudTrail events can trigger CloudWatch Events, which can be used to automate actions, like invoking Lambda functions or sending notifications via SNS.


Event Types

Management Events:
Capture information about management operations on your AWS resources.
Example actions: Launching EC2 instances, creating databases, terminating resources, creating Lambda functions.

Data Events:
Provide more granular information about operations within a resource.
Example: Amazon S3 operations (e.g., object-level API calls like PutObject, GetObject, etc.).

Insights Events:
New Event Type: Focuses on identifying and responding to unusual activity related to write API calls (e.g., sudden spikes in activity).



Automation and Notifications

SNS Topics:
CloudTrail can trigger notifications via SNS topics whenever a log file is published.

CloudWatch Alarms:
Use CloudWatch Logs to create alarms that trigger Lambda functions or SNS notifications based on CloudTrail log events.

Event-Driven Automation:
Events from CloudTrail can trigger automated responses through Lambda functions or SNS notifications.


Key Points for Exam
CloudTrail tracks API actions across AWS services, enabling auditing and automation.
Events are logged to S3 for indefinite retention when a CloudTrail trail is created.
Log File Integrity Validation ensures the logs havenâ€™t been tampered with.
Management events and Data events are key types of logs in CloudTrail.
CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch Events can be used to further process and automate actions based on CloudTrail data.



HOL:


Creating a CloudTrail Trail

1. CloudTrail Overview:
AWS CloudTrail records API activity in your AWS account.
By default, it retains data for 90 days. However, you may want to store this data indefinitely for auditing purposes, which requires creating a CloudTrail trail.

2. Event History:
Event History shows recent API activities, but only for the last 90 days.
To retain events longer or store them for future analysis, you need to create a CloudTrail trail.

3. Creating a CloudTrail Trail:
Navigate to CloudTrail in the AWS Management Console.
Go to the Trails section and select Create Trail.

4. Trail Configuration:
Trail Name: Provide a unique name for the trail (e.g., DCTLabTrainingTrail).
AWS Organizations: You can enable the trail for all accounts within an AWS Organization (if applicable).
S3 Bucket: Choose to create a new S3 bucket (e.g., AWSCloudTrailLogs) to store logs. AWS will generate a random identifier for this bucket.
Encryption: Optional. You can enable KMS encryption, or leave it off.
Log File Validation: Enable log file validation to ensure that the log files are not tampered with.

5. Log Destination Options:
Optionally, logs can be forwarded to CloudWatch Logs for further processing (e.g., triggering alarms, setting up metrics).



Selecting What to Log

1. Management Events:
These include actions such as launching instances, creating buckets, or terminating resources. These are logged by default

2. Data Events:
Include resource-level activities, such as S3 object-level operations (e.g., PutObject, GetObject). Be cautious as they may generate a large volume of data.

3. Insights Events:
Focuses on identifying unusual API activities related to write operations.

4. Choose What API Activities to Log:
by default, read and write activities are logged.
This includes both management events (e.g., EC2 instance launch) and more specific resource-level events.

Review and Create Trail
After selecting the required options, scroll down and click Create Trail.
CloudTrail will automatically create the S3 bucket for logs and start recording events.

Reviewing Logs in S3
After creation, you can go to S3 to view the logs stored in the bucket created by CloudTrail (e.g., AWSCloudTrailLogs).
Logs will be stored in a folder structure, including AWS Logs and the account number.
It may take several minutes for logs to start appearing in the S3 bucket.

Next Steps
The created CloudTrail trail will remain active, and you can use it for future analysis, like integrating it with Amazon EventBridge for event-driven automation.
