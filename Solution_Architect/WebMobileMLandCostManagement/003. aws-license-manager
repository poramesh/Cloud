AWS License Manager 

AWS License Manager helps manage software licenses from vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, SAP, IBM, and others. It provides 
centralized management for AWS and on-premises resources.

Key Features:
Tracks license usage based on virtual cores (vCPUs), sockets, or number of machines.
Manages and distributes software licenses across AWS accounts and organizations.
Enforces limits across multiple AWS regions.
Prevents exceeding license allowances by blocking instance launches when limits are reached.
Provides reports and automated tracking of license usage.



**********************************
Understanding Sockets, Cores, and vCPUs
Socket: A physical slot on a motherboard that holds a processor. A server can have one or multiple sockets.
Core: Each CPU (processor) has multiple cores, which are independent processing units within the CPU.
vCPU (Virtual CPU): In a virtualized environment (like AWS EC2), a vCPU represents a portion of a physical core assigned to a virtual machine.

Example:
A dual-socket server means the motherboard has two CPU slots, allowing two physical processors to be installed.
If each processor has 8 cores, then the total core count is 16.
In AWS, these 16 cores could be mapped to 32 vCPUs (if hyper-threading is enabled).

Why Does Licensing Use Sockets?
Some software vendors (like Microsoft and Oracle) license their products per socket, meaning the number of physical CPU sockets in
a server determines how many licenses you need. Others may license based on cores or vCPUs.

Choose License Type:
Based on cores, vCPUs, sockets, or instances.
Set license count (e.g., 16 vCPUs).
Enable Enforce Limits – Prevents launching new instances if the license limit is reached.
Set License Rules (optional):
Minimum vCPUs required.
Tenancy requirements (Shared, Dedicated Host, or Dedicated Instances).
Enable Automated Discovery – Tracks license usage automatically.
Click Create.

Additional Features:
Host Resource Groups – For dedicated hosts.
