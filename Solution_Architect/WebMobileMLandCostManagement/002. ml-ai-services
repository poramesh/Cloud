AWS Machine Learning and AI Services

AWS provides a broad portfolio of machine learning and AI services, allowing developers to integrate advanced capabilities into their 
applications. Below are some key services and their functionalities:


Amazon Rekognition
- Identifies objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos.
- Performs facial analysis, including emotions, age range, and facial expressions.
- Includes celebrity recognition (e.g., identifying AWS executives like Dr. Werner Vogels).
- Can be integrated into an event-driven architecture:
  - Image upload triggers an event in S3.
  - A Lambda function calls Rekognition to analyze the image.
  - Results are sent to SNS or stored in DynamoDB.

Amazon Transcribe
- Converts speech into text.
- Uses deep learning-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to process and transcribe recorded speech.
- Can be used for applications like customer service, closed captions, and meeting transcriptions.

Amazon Translate
- Neural machine translation service.
- Translates text between multiple languages with high accuracy.
- Can be used alongside Transcribe to process and translate spoken content.
- Common use cases include website localization and multilingual support for applications.

Amazon Comprehend
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that uncovers information from unstructured text.
- Detects sentiment, key phrases, and relationships in text data.
- Can be used for real-time customer sentiment analysis and content categorization.

Amazon Lex
- Conversational AI service for building chatbots using voice and text.
- Used to create interactive bots for applications, contact centers, and customer support.
- Offers built-in speech recognition and natural language understanding.

Amazon DevOps Guru
- Cloud operations service that improves application performance and availability.
- Uses machine learning to detect anomalies in operational data.
- Helps resolve DevOps issues with AI-powered insights.
- Scales operational analytics and reduces alarm noise.

Amazon CodeGuru Security
- Detects, tracks, and fixes code security vulnerabilities throughout the development lifecycle.
- Uses ML and automated reasoning to identify security issues.
- Integrates with IDEs and CI/CD tools via API.
- Provides automatic bug tracking, assisted remediation, and performance optimization recommendations.
- Detects anomalies in application profiles in real-time.

AWS continues to expand its AI/ML offerings, providing developers with powerful tools for automation, security, and analytics.





# Instructions

1. Create an S3 bucket

2. Create a DynamoDB table
- Name: ImageAnalysisResults
- Primary key: ImageName

3. Create a Lambda function
- Name: RekognitionLab
- Runtime: Python 3.9
- Code: Add the following code

```python
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Initialize clients
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    rekognition_client = boto3.client('rekognition')
    dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
    table = dynamodb.Table('YourDynamoDBTableName')  # Replace with your table name

    # Get the S3 bucket name and object key from the event
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']

    # Call Amazon Rekognition to detect labels in the image
    response = rekognition_client.detect_labels(
        Image={'S3Object': {'Bucket': bucket_name, 'Name': object_key}},
        MaxLabels=10
    )

    # Store the labels detected in DynamoDB
    labels = [{'Confidence': label['Confidence'], 'Name': label['Name']} for label in response['Labels']]
    table.put_item(
        Item={
            'ImageName': object_key,
            'Labels': json.dumps(labels)
        }
    )

    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Image processed successfully!')
    }
```

4. Edit the table name in the code and deploy

5. Add permissions to Lambda
- AmazonRekognitionFullAccess
- AmazonDynamoDBFullAccess
- AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess

6. In Lambda create a trigger for object creation events in the S3 bucket
7. Upload images to the bucket and review the results in DynamoDB
