AWS Cost Allocation Tags 

Purpose: Helps organize AWS resources and track costs based on tags.
Key Benefit: Allows users to attribute costs to specific departments, teams, or users.
Used in: AWS Billing Console and Cost Explorer for cost analysis.


Types of Cost Allocation Tags

User-Defined Tags
Created manually by users to track resources.
Example:
Tag Key: Department
Tag Value: Operations
Used to categorize resources for better cost tracking.

AWS-Generated Tags
Pre-configured by AWS and cannot be modified.
Example: CreatedBy (identifies the IAM user or role that launched the resource).
Must be enabled manually before AWS starts using them in reports.



Enabling Cost Allocation Tags

Go to AWS Billing Dashboard
Navigate to "Cost Allocation Tags"
Enable AWS-Generated Tags (e.g., CreatedBy).
Activate User-Defined Tags that have been applied to resources.
Wait for AWS to process the data (may take a few days).



Using Cost Allocation Tags in Cost Explorer

Go to AWS Cost Explorer.
Apply Filters:
Filter by Department → See costs related to Operations.
Filter by Created By → Identify which IAM user launched resources.
View Cost Breakdown based on these tags.
Analyze Spending Trends across different teams or roles.


Example Use Case
A company applies Department = Operations to all EC2 instances used by the operations team.
Later, in Cost Explorer, they filter by Department = Operations to see total spending for that team.


Summary
Cost Allocation Tags help organize resources and track spending at a granular level.
User-Defined Tags allow custom cost tracking based on business needs.
AWS-Generated Tags automatically assign costs to users or roles.
Cost Explorer Integration helps analyze and optimize AWS spending.
