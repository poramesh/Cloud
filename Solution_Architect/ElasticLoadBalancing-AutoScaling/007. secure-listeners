Secure Listeners for Elastic Load Balancers

Secure listeners enable SSL/TLS encryption to ensure secure communication between clients and the application through an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB).
Certificates (e.g., AWS Certificate Manager or third-party certificates) are used to establish encryption.


Encryption Options by Load Balancer Type

Application Load Balancer (ALB)

1. Encrypted Communication Between Client and Load Balancer:
Add an SSL/TLS certificate to the ALB.
Certificate options:
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).
Imported certificate in ACM or IAM.
Ensures encrypted traffic over the internet to the ALB.

2. Unencrypted Communication Within the VPC:
Communication from ALB to application instances within the VPC remains unencrypted.
Suitable if:
Compliance or security requirements allow unencrypted traffic within the VPC.
Simplicity of managing only one certificate is preferred.

3. Encryption End-to-End:
Add certificates at both the ALB and the application server levels.
Certificates for application instances:
Use self-signed certificates or private certificate authorities (CA).
ACM public certificates cannot be used as their private keys are not exportable(cant export private key).
Ensures full encryption from client to application server.


Network Load Balancer (NLB)

1. Single Encrypted Connection:
The client-to-application communication is encrypted through the NLB.
Add a public SSL/TLS certificate on the application instance.
Certificates must be from third-party certificate authorities; ACM cannot be used due to private key export restrictions.

2. Two Encrypted Connections:
SSL/TLS termination at the NLB:
Add an ACM certificate at the NLB level.
A second encrypted channel from NLB to the application instance:
Requires a separate certificate installed on the instance.
Provides SSL offloading at the NLB while maintaining encryption within the VPC.


Key Considerations

ALB vs. NLB:
ALB operates at Layer 7 (application layer) and requires two separate connections: client-to-ALB and ALB-to-application server.
NLB operates at Layer 4 (network layer) and supports a single encrypted channel.

Certificate Management:
ACM certificates are suitable for load balancers but not directly for application instances (private keys are non-exportable).
Use third-party certificates for instances needing encryption.

Compliance Requirements:
Some scenarios (e.g., sensitive data, strict compliance standards) may require end-to-end encryption.


Summary

Application Load Balancer:
Supports either partial (client to ALB) or full encryption (client to application instance).
Offers flexibility with Layer 7 capabilities.

Network Load Balancer:
Allows single-channel encryption for simpler setups or two-channel encryption for added flexibility.
Operates at Layer 4 for high performance and low latency.
Choose the approach based on security requirements, compliance mandates, and application architecture.

Setting Up a Secure Listener for an Application Load Balancer (ALB)

This process involves creating a secure listener (HTTPS) for an Application Load Balancer (ALB) using CloudFormation. You'll use a Route 53 domain,
an SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM), and automate the setup via a CloudFormation template.

Steps

1. Prerequisites

Route 53 Domain:
Ensure you have a domain registered in Route 53.
If not registered, this step might take some time due to delays in domain propagation.

SSL/TLS Certificate:
Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to request and validate a public SSL/TLS certificate for your domain.

Validation Method:
Use DNS validation for reliability over email.
Validation involves adding a CNAME record to your hosted zone in Route 53.


2. Launching ALB with CloudFormation

CloudFormation Template:
Download the provided file.

This template creates an ALB, instances in two availability zones, and necessary configurations.

Create a CloudFormation Stack:
Go to the CloudFormation console and upload the template.
and then we gotta fill the parameters that acts as input.

Fill in the parameters:
AMI ID: Obtain the latest Amazon Linux AMI ID from the EC2 console.
Instance Type: Default is t2.micro.
VPC and Subnets: Choose your VPC and two subnets from the same VPC.
Deployment:
Submit the stack and let CloudFormation provision the infrastructure.
Monitor progress in the Events tab.


3. Configuring the SSL/TLS Certificate

AWS Certificate Manager (ACM):
Request a public SSL/TLS certificate for your domain in ACM. (enter the domain name)
Use DNS validation and click on create the required CNAME record in Route 53.(this we do it to verify if we have permission to do it)
Wait for the certificate to change status to Issued.

Route 53 Hosted Zone:
Verify the CNAME record was created successfully in your hosted zone, once it is created here, we can deelte as it has been verifiied.
Ensure no other essential records like NS or SOA are deleted.


((((((((((((((((
1. Access AWS Certificate Manager
Navigate to the AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) service in the AWS Management Console.

2. Request a Certificate
Click Request a Certificate.
Choose Public Certificate (for a domain accessible on the internet).
Enter your domain name(s):
Example: example.com or *.example.com (for a wildcard certificate).

3. Validate Domain Ownership
You need to prove ownership of the domain you’re requesting a certificate for. There are two methods:

DNS Validation (Recommended):
ACM provides a DNS CNAME record.
This record must be added to your domain's DNS settings.
AWS automatically validates the ownership after the record is detected.
Email Validation:
ACM sends an email to the domain's registered contacts.
You must respond to the email to validate.
Why DNS Validation is Preferred:
It's automated and faster.
Requires no manual intervention once the record is set up.

4. Create the DNS CNAME Record
ACM provides the CNAME record details (Name, Type, and Value).
If your domain is hosted in Route 53, ACM can create this record automatically. Click Create Records in Route 53.
If your domain is hosted elsewhere, you need to manually create the record in your DNS management console.

5. Wait for Validation
Once the CNAME record is set up, ACM periodically checks for the record.
The status changes from Pending Validation to Issued after validation is successful.

6. Use the Certificate
The issued certificate is now available for use in AWS services like:
Elastic Load Balancers (ALBs or NLBs).
CloudFront distributions.
API Gateway.
))))))))))

4. Adding a Secure Listener

Access ALB Configuration:
Navigate to the Listeners and Rules section of the ALB.

Add a Listener:
Protocol: Choose HTTPS (port 443).
Forwarding Target: Use the same target group as the HTTP listener.
Security Policy: Keep the default.
SSL/TLS Certificate:
Select the certificate issued via ACM.

5. Updating Security Groups

Modify the ALB and instance security groups to allow inbound HTTPS (port 443) traffic.

6. DNS Configuration for Secure Access

Route 53 A Record: (cause the dns record that we usually hit for load balancer is for http :80)
Create an Alias A Record pointing to your ALB’s DNS name.
Select the region and the ALB from the list.

Test HTTPS Access:
Access your application using the domain name (e.g., https://yourdomain.com).
Verify the secure connection by checking the padlock icon in the browser.

7. Cleanup
Delete Resources:
Delete the A record in Route 53 if you no longer need it.
Use the CloudFormation console to delete the stack, which removes all associated resources.

Keep/Remove Certificate:
Keep the certificate in ACM for future testing or delete it to avoid charges.


Key Points to Remember
CloudFormation Templates: Automate resource creation and ensure consistent setups.
DNS Validation: Reliable and easy to manage for domain ownership verification.
Security Groups: Update rules to allow both HTTP and HTTPS as required.
Infrastructure Management: Clean up resources through CloudFormation to avoid orphaned components or extra costs.
