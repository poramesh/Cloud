Cross-Zone Load Balancing Notes


Definition:
Cross-Zone Load Balancing ensures that traffic is distributed evenly across all available targets in enabled Availability Zones (AZs) 
or just within a single AZ, depending on whether it's enabled or not.


When Cross-Zone Load Balancing is Disabled:
Each load balancer node distributes traffic only within its own AZ.

Example:
AZ-A has 3 targets: Each target receives 16.6% of traffic.
AZ-B has 2 targets: Each target receives 25% of traffic.
Traffic is uneven across AZs, especially when there is an unequal number of targets.


When Cross-Zone Load Balancing is Enabled:
The load balancer distributes traffic evenly across all targets in all enabled AZs.
Example:
There are 5 targets in total (3 in AZ-A and 2 in AZ-B).
Each target receives 20% of traffic, resulting in more even distribution.
Traffic is more balanced, even if the number of targets in each AZ is unequal.


Application Load Balancer (ALB):
Cross-zone load balancing is always enabled by default.

Network Load Balancer (NLB) and Gateway Load Balancer (GLB):
Cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default.

Benefits of Cross-Zone Load Balancing:
Helps distribute traffic evenly across targets in different AZs.
Useful when there is an uneven distribution of instances across AZs.

In cases where Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) are used, the scaling ensures instances are evenly distributed, making cross-zone load balancing less 
critical, but still beneficial in some cases.

Use Case:
If your instances are not evenly distributed across AZs, enabling cross-zone load balancing will make sure the traffic is more evenly balanced.
Helps avoid overloading targets in one AZ while underutilizing targets in another AZ.
