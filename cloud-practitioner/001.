Cloud Computing:

Definition: Using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than using local servers or personal computers.


On-Premise vs Cloud Providers

On-Premise:
You own the servers (hardware and software).
You hire and manage IT staff for server maintenance and configurations.
You pay or rent real estate to house the physical servers (data centers).
You take full responsibility for any risks (hardware failures, maintenance, etc.).

Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure):
The cloud provider owns and maintains the servers.
They hire IT professionals to monitor and maintain servers.
Cloud providers rent the real estate (data centers) to house servers.
Shared responsibility model: You are responsible for configuring the cloud services and deploying code, while the provider handles the rest.

Advantages of Cloud Computing Over On-Premise:
Trade Capital Expense for Variable Expense:

On-prem requires large upfront investment in data centers and servers.
Cloud providers allow you to pay on-demand, only for the resources you use.
Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale:

With cloud computing, the costs are shared among hundreds of thousands of customers.
This leads to significant cost savings that are not possible with on-prem solutions.
Stop Guessing Capacity:

No need to over-provision servers for potential future use.
Cloud providers allow you to scale resources up or down based on actual demand.
Increased Speed and Agility:

Cloud computing enables quick deployment of resources (within minutes).
No need to wait for weeks or months for on-premise IT setup.
Stop Spending on Data Centers:

Cloud providers handle the physical data center operations (servers, IT staff, maintenance).
You can focus more on your customers and less on infrastructure management.
Go Global in Minutes:

Cloud allows you to deploy applications across multiple global regions with minimal effort.
This improves customer experience by reducing latency at lower costs.
