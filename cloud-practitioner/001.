Cloud Computing:

Definition: Using remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, rather than using local servers or personal computers.


On-Premise vs Cloud Providers

On-Premise:
You own the servers (hardware and software).
You hire and manage IT staff for server maintenance and configurations.
You pay or rent real estate to house the physical servers (data centers).
You take full responsibility for any risks (hardware failures, maintenance, etc.).

Cloud Providers (AWS, GCP, Azure):
The cloud provider owns and maintains the servers.
They hire IT professionals to monitor and maintain servers.
Cloud providers rent the real estate (data centers) to house servers.
Shared responsibility model: You are responsible for configuring the cloud services and deploying code, while the provider handles the rest.




Advantages of Cloud Computing Over On-Premise:

1. Trade Capital Expense for Variable Expense:
On-prem requires large upfront investment in data centers and servers.
Cloud providers allow you to pay on-demand, only for the resources you use.

2. Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale:
With cloud computing, the costs are shared among hundreds of thousands of customers.
This leads to significant cost savings that are not possible with on-prem solutions.

3. Stop Guessing Capacity:
No need to over-provision servers for potential future use.
Cloud providers allow you to scale resources up or down based on actual demand.

4. Increased Speed and Agility:
Cloud computing enables quick deployment of resources (within minutes).
No need to wait for weeks or months for on-premise IT setup.

5. Stop Spending on Data Centers:
Cloud providers handle the physical data center operations (servers, IT staff, maintenance).
You can focus more on your customers and less on infrastructure management.

6. Go Global in Minutes:
Cloud allows you to deploy applications across multiple global regions with minimal effort.
This improves customer experience by reducing latency at lower costs.




Types of Cloud Computing:

1. Software as a Service (SaaS): 

SaaS (Software as a Service) is a software delivery model in which applications are hosted in the cloud and made available to users over the internet. 
Instead of purchasing and installing software on individual devices, users subscribe to the software and access it via a web browser.

Both Facebook and Gmail exemplify the SaaS model by providing users with access to their services via the internet without the need for
installation or maintenance on personal devices.

>MAINLY FOR CUSTOMERS.
>Provides a fully managed and completed product run by the service provider.
>Users don't have to manage or maintain the service—it just works.

Examples: Gmail, Office 365, Salesforce.

2. Platform as a Service (PaaS):
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing service model that provides a platform allowing developers to build, deploy, and manage applications 
without the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure. PaaS provides a complete development environment, including hardware, software,
and tools needed for application development, enabling developers to focus on coding and application functionality.

>MAINLY FOR DEVELOPERS.
>Removes the need to manage underlying infrastructure, allowing the focus to be on app deployment and management.
>No need to worry about provisioning or configuring hardware.
Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine.

3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing service model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. 
In the IaaS model, cloud providers offer physical and virtual resources such as servers, storage, networks, and operating systems on a 
pay-as-you-go basis. This allows businesses and developers to provision and manage their IT infrastructure without the need to 
invest in or manage physical hardware.

>MIANLY FOR IT ADMINS.
>Provides the basic building blocks for cloud computing: networking, computing power, and data storage.
>No need to manage IT staff, data centers, or hardware.
>Allows you to build custom solutions on top of this infrastructure.
Examples: AWS, GCP, Azure.

Key Features of IaaS:

Virtualized Hardware: IaaS provides virtual machines (VMs) that can run different operating systems and applications, allowing users 
to customize their environments according to their needs.

Scalability: IaaS solutions offer flexible scaling options, enabling users to increase or decrease resources based on demand. This is
particularly useful for handling varying workloads.

Pay-as-You-Go Pricing: Users pay only for the resources they use, which helps optimize costs and allows for budgeting
based on actual consumption.

Network Infrastructure: IaaS includes virtual networking components, such as firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs, which enable 
secure communication and connectivity.

Self-Service and Automation: Users can provision and manage resources through web-based dashboards or APIs, facilitating automation
and reducing the need for manual intervention.

Disaster Recovery and Backup: Many IaaS providers offer built-in options for backup, recovery, and data redundancy, enhancing data 
protection and business continuity.

Cloud Computing Deployment Models:

1. Cloud (Fully Cloud-Based):

The organization uses cloud services for all its needs.
Very low cost, ideal for startups.
Examples: Squarespace, Basecamp, Dropbox.

SaaS offerings typically benefit from being fully on the cloud, especially when the size of the company or application doesn't require complex 
infrastructure or regulatory oversight.
New projects and companies without red tape can easily design their systems to be 100% cloud-based.


2. On-Premise (Fully On-Prem):

Deploying resources on the company’s own premises using virtualization and resource management tools (sometimes called private cloud).
The organization manages its own data centers and servers on-site.
Involves significant upfront costs for infrastructure and maintenance.

Still widely used by the public sector (e.g., government) and industries dealing with highly sensitive data (e.g., hospitals for health records).
Also used by heavily regulated industries (e.g., insurance) that are cautious about cloud usage, though some of these industries are slowly adopting cloud.



3. Hybrid Cloud:

A combination of both cloud and on-premise solutions, often connected through hybrid services.
Companies use the cloud for some services while keeping other sensitive data and services on-premise for security or compliance reasons.

Commonly used by banks, fintech, investment management firms, and large professional service providers.
Adopted by organizations with legacy on-premise environments or customers not comfortable with cloud computing.
Some organizations may have started entirely on the cloud if they didn’t have existing infrastructure or customer concerns.







AWS Global Infrastructure:

AWS offers region maps that show the coverage across continents like North America, South America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.
AWS serves over a million active customers in more than 190 countries, with expanding mobile infrastructure for low latency and high throughput.
AWS global infrastructure consists of 69 availability zones (AZs) across 22 geographical regions.

1. Regions:

Geographically distinct locations with multiple data centers.
Each region is physically isolated and independent in terms of power, location, and water supply.

North America has regions in Ohio, Oregon, North California, North Virginia, and Canada.
South America has a region in Brazil.
Europe includes regions in London, Stockholm, Frankfurt, Paris, and Ireland.
Asia Pacific includes regions like Mainland China, Sydney (Australia), Tokyo (Japan), Seoul (Korea), Mumbai (India), and Hong Kong.

Availability of Services: Not all AWS services are available in every region.
For example, Amazon Connect is available only in North Virginia and North Carolina.
AWS DeepLens is available only in Northern Virginia.
Regions are shown in checkboxes for services across continents (e.g., Ireland in Europe and Singapore in Asia Pacific offer many services).


US East (North Virginia)
The largest AWS region.
New services and features are often made available here first.
Not all services are available in every region, so users looking for new AWS features should use US East (North Virginia)


2. Availability Zones (AZs):

An AZ is a data center owned and operated by AWS where its services run.
Every region has at least two AZs; AWS is moving towards having at least three AZs in each region.
Region Codes: AZs are represented by region codes followed by letters (e.g., US East 1a, 1b, etc. for North Virginia).
North Virginia has six AZs labeled A, B, C, D, E, F.

Multi-AZ Concept
Distributing instances across multiple AZs allows for failover configuration.
In case one AZ goes down, the workload can automatically shift to another AZ.
The latency between AZs is less than 10 milliseconds as they are purposefully positioned to maintain this low latency.




3. Edge Locations:

Edge locations are data centers owned by AWS’s trusted partners or AWS itself. They connect directly to the AWS network
and support services like CloudFront, S3 Transfer Acceleration, and API Gateway.
Requests made to CloudFront or S3 will be automatically routed to the nearest edge location.

In AWS, an Edge Location is a site that AWS uses to cache content closer to end users, improving the speed and performance of applications. 
Edge Locations are part of the Amazon CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) and are strategically positioned around the world to reduce
latency for users accessing data and applications hosted on AWS.



Functionality:
Edge locations allow for low-latency uploads and serve data requests quickly based on the user's geographic location.
Global Reach:
Edge locations outnumber availability zones, ensuring faster service delivery worldwide.
For example, Atlanta alone has five edge locations.


Key Features of Edge Locations:

Content Delivery:
Edge Locations cache copies of static and dynamic content (like images, videos, and APIs) so that when users request this content, 
it can be delivered from the nearest Edge Location, rather than the origin server. This reduces the time it takes for data to travel over the network.

Low Latency:
By serving content from locations that are geographically closer to the user, Edge Locations significantly reduce the round-trip time for data transmission,
resulting in faster load times for applications and websites.

Global Network:

AWS has a large number of Edge Locations distributed around the world, which enables users to reach a global audience and deliver content 
with minimal delay regardless of location.

Integrated with Other AWS Services:

Edge Locations work seamlessly with services like Amazon S3 (for storage), AWS Lambda (for serverless computing), and AWS Shield (for DDoS protection),
among others, to provide a comprehensive solution for deploying applications and content.

Dynamic Content Handling:
While primarily used for caching static content, Edge Locations can also handle dynamic content by routing requests to the appropriate origin 
servers and caching responses as needed.

Security:
Edge Locations support HTTPS, which ensures that data transferred between the user and the Edge Location is encrypted. They also provide 
protection against DDoS attacks through AWS Shield.

Use Cases for Edge Locations:

Website Acceleration:
Serving images, CSS, JavaScript, and other resources from Edge Locations can significantly speed up website loading times for users around the world.

Video Streaming:
Edge Locations are used to deliver video content with low latency and buffering, enhancing the user experience for streaming applications.

APIs:
Edge Locations can cache API responses to improve the performance of applications that rely on external data.

Software Distribution:
Companies can use Edge Locations to distribute software updates or patches quickly to users globally.
